The condition `i * i <= num` is an efficient way to do this without calculating the square root directly.\\n        *   **`if num % i == 0:`**: If `num` is divisible by `i` (meaning the remainder is 0), then `num` has a divisor other than 1 and itself, so it\\'s not prime. We return `False`.\\n        *   **`i += 2`**: Since we\\'ve already ruled out even numbers, we only need to check odd potential divisors, so we increment `i` by 2 in each step (3, 5, 7, 9, ...).\\n    *   **`return True`**: If the loop finishes without finding any divisors, it means the number is prime.\\n\\n2.  **Main Loop:**\\n    *   **`for number in range(1, 101):`**: This loop iterates through integers starting from 1 up to (but not including) 101, effectively covering the range 1 to 100.\\n    *   **`if is_prime(number):`**: For each `number` in the range, it calls the `is_prime()` function.\\n    *   **`print(number)`**: If `is_prime()` returns `True`, the number is printed.',\n",
