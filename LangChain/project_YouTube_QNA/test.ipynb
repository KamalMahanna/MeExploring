I want to tell all young people the\\nfollowing: No matter how dark the night may seem, it is still just night, and morning is\\nbound to come',\n",
       "  \"- The following is a\\nconversation with Narendra Modi,.  the Prime Minister of India. It was one of the most moving\\nconversations and experiences of my life. Allow me here to say a few words about it. Please skip ahead straight to\\nour conversation, if you like. Narendra Modi's life story is incredible. He rose from poverty to lead a\\nnation of 1.4 billion people, the biggest democracy in the world, where he won epic-scale elections\\nfor Prime Minister three times\",\n",
       "  \"As a leader, he fought for\\nideas that unite his nation of India,.  a nation that is composed\\nof a large number of highly varied and\\ndisparate cultures and peoples who have a long history marked by\\nreligious, social, and political frictions. He's known for taking decisive,\\nat times, controversial actions for which he's loved by hundreds of millions\\nof people, and is also criticized by many. We discuss all of this at\\nlength in this conversation\",\n",
       "  \"On the world stage,\\nhe's respected as a peacemaker and friend.  by most major world leaders, even those\\nwhose nations are at war with each other, from United States to China,\\nto Ukraine and Russia, to Israel, Palestine, and the Middle East,\\nand everywhere else\",\n",
       "  \"Now, at this moment in history,\\nit's clear, at least to me, that the flourishing of human civilization\\nhangs in the balance, with several wars on the brink of escalation\\nto regional and even global conflict, rising tensions between nuclear powers,.  technological developments\\nfrom AI to nuclear fusion that aim to completely transform\\nsociety and geopolitics as we know it, and, of course, generally,\\nincreasing political and cultural turmoil\",\n",
       "  \"So now more than ever,\\nwe need great leaders, great peacemakers, who build\\nbridges, not destroy them,.  who may preserve the\\nidentity of their nations, but still celebrate the common\\nhumanity of all of us, all people on Earth. For this and many other reasons,\\nthis conversation with Prime Minister Modi was one of the most\\nremarkable I've ever had. You may hear such words and think\\nthat I'm just enamored by power or access. No, never was, never will be\",\n",
       "  \"I do not idolize anyone,\\nespecially those in power..  I'm generally skeptical\\nof power, money, and fame because of their natural\\ncorrupting influence on the mind, the heart, the soul of a person. The whole point of all the conversations I've had in my life, on mic and off mic, is that I try to see and\\nexplore the full complexity of every human being,\\nthe good and the bad. I believe we're all the same\\nin a deep fundamental sense\",\n",
       "  \"All capable of good, all capable of evil, all carry stories of\\npain and stories of hope,.  whether you're a world\\nleader or a truck driver, a coal miner or a farmer\\nin the American Midwest, and, by the way, I will be talking to a lot of the\\nlatter kind of folk this year, off mic, and maybe even on mic, as I\\ntravel the US and the world. My brief statements\\nhere about Narendra Modi are about both him as a leader\\nand especially him as a human being\",\n",
       "  'In the extensive time I spent with him, I spoke with him off mic and on mic..  It was a deeply personal human interaction characterized by warmth, kindness, humor,\\ninner and outer peace, and absolute focus on the\\nconversation between us in the present moment as\\nif nothing else existed. I have heard from many people that he treats everyone he\\nmeets in this empathic way, no matter where they come from, or what their position is in this world',\n",
       "  'So, for those and many other reasons, this really was an incredible experience\\nI will never forget..  Oh, and by the way, we made captions and\\nvoiceover audio tracks available in English,\\nHindi, and other languages. You can also listen to the original\\nmixed-language version where I speak English and Prime Minister Modi speaks Hindi. Separately, you can choose to turn\\non subtitles in your preferred language',\n",
       "  'On YouTube, you can switch\\nbetween language audio tracks by clicking the Settings gear icon,\\nthen clicking Audio Track,.  and then selecting the\\nlanguage you prefer.

       "  \"So you can listen either to a version\\nthat is all one language, or to the original mixed-language version\\nwith subtitles in your preferred language,.  the default is English overdub. All thanks to ElevenLabs and\\na great team of translators, we do our best to bring the\\nPrime Minister's voice to life with AI voice cloning in English\",\n",
       "  'I promise that we will\\ncontinue to work very hard to break down the barriers\\nthat language creates, and try to make these conversations as accessible as possible\\nto everyone in the world..  Anyway, let me pause one more\\ntime to say a big thank you. What a wild ride this life has been. It\\'s an honor for me to be on\\nit with all of you. I love you all. This is the \"Lex Fridman Podcast.\" And now, dear friends, here\\'s\\nthe Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi',\n",
       "  \"So, I should also say,\\nI’m fasting right now..  It’s been almost two days, 45 hours. So just water, no food, in honor of this\\nconversation, just to get in the right mindset, get into\\nthe spiritual level. I’ve read that you often\\nfast for many days. Can you explain why you fast and where\\ndoes your mind go when you fast? - First of all, I’m truly, pleasantly\\nsurprised and honored that you’re fasting. All the more because it feels like you're\\nfasting as a tribute of respect for me\",\n",
       "  'So I express my deepest gratitude to you\\nfor doing this..  In India, our religious traditions are actually a\\nway of life. Our Supreme Court once gave a brilliant\\ninterpretation of Hinduism. They have stated that Hinduism is not\\nabout rituals or methods of worship. But rather it is a way of living, a philosophy that guides life itself. And in our scriptures, there is deep discussion on elevating the body, mind, intellect,\\nsoul, and humanity',\n",
       "  'They outline various paths, traditions,\\nand systems to achieve this.  and fasting is one of them. But fasting alone isn’t everything. In India, whether you see it culturally or\\nphilosophically, sometimes, I see that fasting is a way to\\ncultivate discipline. If I put it in simple terms, or explain it to the viewers who are\\nunfamiliar with India, it is a powerful tool to bring both the inner and outer\\nself into balance',\n",
       "  \"It shapes life in profound ways.\\nWhen you fast, You may have noticed, as you said, you've\\nbeen fasting on water for two days..  Every single one of your senses, especially smell, touch, and taste, becomes highly sensitive. You may even notice the subtle aroma of\\nwater itself, something you probably never noticed\\nbefore when drinking it. If someone walks past you carrying tea, you will catch its aroma, just like you\\nwould with coffee\",\n",
       "  'A small flower you’ve seen before, you\\nwill see it again today,.  but now, you can perceive its details more\\nvividly. Your senses become extra sharp, highly aware, and\\nfully tuned in. And uh, their capability, to observe and to respond, multiplies and\\ngrows sharper. I have personally often experienced this. Another thing I’ve experienced is that\\nfasting can greatly accelerate the thinking\\nprocess and can, uh, give a fresh\\nperspective. You start thinking outside the box',\n",
       "  'I don’t know if everyone experiences this,\\nbut I certainly do..  Most people assume that fasting simply\\nmeans giving up food or not eating. But that’s just the physical aspect of\\nfasting. If someone is forced to go without food\\ndue to hardship, with an empty stomach,\\ncan we call that fasting? Fasting is actually a scientific process. Whenever I fast for an extended period, I\\nprepare my body in advance',\n",
       "  'For 5 to 7 days before the fast, I follow various Ayurvedic practices and\\nyoga practices, along with other traditional cleansing\\nmethods to internally reset my system..  Before actually beginning the fast, I make sure to drink a lot of water, as\\nmuch as possible. So, you could say that this detoxification\\nprocess helps prepare my body in the best possible\\nway. And once I begin fasting, for me, it’s an\\nact of devotion. For me fasting is a form of\\nself-discipline',\n",
       "  'For me, personally, even while I go about\\ndoing my daily activities during a fast,.  my mind remains deeply introspective and\\nfocused inward. And that experience is profoundly\\ntransformative for me. My practice of fasting didn’t come from\\nreading books, listening to sermons, or following a tradition just because my\\nfamily happened to have observed it. It came from my own personal experience',\n",
       "  'During my school days, there was a movement inspired by Mahatma\\nGandhi’s vision his vision of cow protection..  The government had not enacted any laws at\\nthe time. At the time, people across the country observed a one-day fast by gathering in\\npublic places in silent protest. We were just kids, probably had just\\nfinished primary school. Something inside me said, \"I should be\\npart of this.\" And that was the first time in my life I\\nexperienced fasting',\n",
       "  'At such a young age, I felt neither hunger\\nnor any desire for food..  Instead, I felt a new awareness, a surge\\nof energy within me. So, I became convinced that fasting is a\\nscience, far beyond just skipping meals. It is something far greater than that. Then, gradually, I refined my body and\\nmind through various experiments. Over time, it became a long and\\ndisciplined journey for me. And one thing is certain, fasting never\\nslows me down. I work just as much as usual, sometimes I\\neven work more',\n",
       "  'And another fascinating thing I’ve noticed\\nis that.  when I need to express my\\nthoughts, I’m amazed at where they come from and how\\nthey flow. - Yeah. - It’s truly an incredible experience. - So you still do meetings with\\nworld leaders, you still manage the affairs of India, you still carry out your role as a leader\\non the world stage, all fasted and sometimes nine days? - Well, this practice has a long\\nhistorical context. I hope it may be\\ninteresting for those listening',\n",
       "  'There is an ancient tradition in India\\ncalled Chaturmas..  During the monsoon season, we know that\\nthe digestion tends to slow down. And so, in this season, many people in India follow the practice\\nof eating only a single meal within 24\\nhours. For me, this starts around mid-June and\\ngoes on until after Diwali, around November. For about four to four and a half months, I follow this tradition of eating only\\nonce in 24 hours',\n",
       "  'Then comes the Navratri festival in India, which usually falls in September or\\nOctober.  During this time, the whole country\\ncelebrates Durga Puja, a festival of strength, devotion, and\\nspiritual discipline. This lasts for nine days. During this time, I completely abstain\\nfrom food and only drink hot water. Although, drinking hot water has always\\nbeen a part of my daily routine. My past lifestyle was such that I\\nnaturally developed this habit over time',\n",
       "  'Then, in March or April, another Navratri\\noccurs, called Chaitra Navratri..  This year, it will likely begin around\\nMarch 31st. During this nine-day fast, I eat only one\\nspecific fruit, once a day. So for those nine days, if let’s say I\\nchoose papaya. then for all nine days, I won’t touch\\nanything else, just papaya. That too I eat only once a day. That’s how\\nI follow my nine-day fasting routine',\n",
       "  'So there are numerous fasts I keep\\nthroughout the year, and this has become a\\ndeeply ingrained tradition in my life..  Perhaps I can say that I’ve been following\\nthese practices for 50 to 55 years',\n",
       "  \"- Has there been times when you met with a\\nworld leader and completely fasted? And maybe what do they think about that? What do they think about your ability to\\ndo that kind of thing? And you're right, I should mention that\\nfrom even my two days, my ability to be\\npresent, my ability to sense everything sharply\\nfocus on this experience is elevated.\",\n",
       "  'But yes, is there stories with a world\\nleader that maybe jumped to mind when you were\\nfasted? - Well, most of the time, I don’t even let\\npeople know about it..  It’s my personal matter. So I never publicized\\nit, but people gradually started finding out. It became known only after I became\\nChief Minister and Prime Minister. Otherwise, it was purely personal. But now that it’s out in the open, I don’t\\nmind sharing. If someone asks, I tell them so it might\\nbe useful to them',\n",
       "  'Because it’s not my personal property..  It’s my experience. And if that can help\\nsomeone, why not share it? After all, my life has always been devoted\\nto the well-being of others. For example, after I\\nbecame Prime Minister, I had a bilateral meeting at the White\\nHouse with President Obama, and he had also arranged a formal dinner',\n",
       "  'Then, as discussions between the two\\ngovernments progressed, someone said, \"Please, join us for\\ndinner.\" To which another replied, \"But the Prime\\nMinister doesn’t eat.\".  This left them a bit concerned. How do you host the leader of such a major\\nnation at the White House without serving food? When we sat down, they brought me a glass\\nof hot water. I turned to President Obama and jokingly\\nsaid, \"Look, my dinner has arrived!\" as I placed the glass in front of me',\n",
       "  'Later, when I visited again, he still\\nremembered..  He smiled and said, \"Last time, you were\\nfasting.\" This time, we\\'re having lunch Since you\\'re not fasting, you’ll have to\\neat twice as much! - Let\\'s go to the beginning. You rose from humble beginnings to lead\\nthe world\\'s largest democracy. So, I think there\\'s a lot of people for\\nwhom this is truly inspiring. Your family was of very modest means, and\\nyou grew up in a one-room house with a mud floor, your whole family living\\nthere',\n",
       "  'Tell me about your childhood..  How did those humble beginnings shape your\\noutlook on life? - My birthplace is in Gujarat, specifically in North Gujarat, in Mehsana\\nDistrict, in a small town called Vadnagar. Historically, this town holds great\\nsignificance. And so, Vadnagar is where I was born and\\ncompleted my early education. Looking at the world as I\\nunderstand it today, I can reflect on my childhood and\\nthe unique environment I grew up in',\n",
       "  'My village had certain fascinating\\naspects, some of which are quite rare,\\neven globally..  When I was in school, there was an elder\\nin our village who would regularly tell students,\\n\"Listen, kids, wherever you go, if you find a carved stone or you find a\\nstone with inscriptions on it, or anything with engravings, bring it and\\nplace it in this corner of the school. Over time, my curiosity grew, and I\\nstarted to understand, I realized that my village had a rich and ancient history',\n",
       "  'Discussions at school often revealed more\\nfascinating details about its past..  Later, I learned that China even made a\\nfilm about it. I had read in a newspaper about a film\\nthat mentioned the Chinese philosopher Hiuen Tsang, who had spent a considerable amount of\\ntime in my village, having arrived there many centuries ago. Back then, it was a major center for\\nBuddhist learning. That’s how I first learned about it. And perhaps, around the 1400s, it was a\\nprominent Buddhist educational hub',\n",
       "  'There was a Victory Monument from the 12th\\ncentury,.  a temple from the 17th century, and in the 16th century, two sisters, Tana\\nand Riri, who were renowned musicians. As I uncovered these history traces, I\\ngrasped the depth of our heritage. So, when I became Chief Minister, I\\ninitiated large-scale excavation projects. The findings from these very projects\\nconfirmed that thousands of Buddhist monks\\nhad, at one time, studied there',\n",
       "  'It was a place where Buddhist, Jain, and\\nHindu traditions coexisted harmoniously..  And, for us, history wasn’t just confined\\nto books. Every stone spoke, every wall had a story\\nto tell. And so when we began the large-scale\\nexcavation work, we uncovered findings that hold immense\\nhistorical significance. So far, they have discovered evidence\\ndating back 2,800 years, proving that this city has remained\\nunbroken and eternal for all those 2800\\nyears',\n",
       "  'They have discovered solid proof of how\\nits development unfolded over these\\ncenturies..  Now, an international-level museum has\\nbeen established there, open to visitors Especially for archaeology students, it\\nhas become a major area of study. So, the place where I was born holds its\\nown unique historical significance. I see it as my good fortune; some things\\nin life unfold beyond our understanding. Kashi became my realm of duty. Now Kashi is also eternal',\n",
       "  'Kashi, also\\nknown as Banaras or Varanasi,.  is an eternal city that has remained\\nvibrant and alive for centuries. Perhaps, it was some divine design that\\nled a boy born in Vadnagar to eventually make Kashi his realm of\\nduty, living in the embrace of Mother\\nGanga. When I think about my family, my father,\\nmy mother, my siblings, my uncles, aunts,\\ngrandparents, we all grew up together in a\\nsmall house. The place we lived was likely even smaller\\nthan where we are sitting now',\n",
       "  'There was no window, just a small door..  That’s where I was born, that’s where I\\ngrew up. Now, when people talk about poverty, it’s natural to discuss it in the context\\nof public life. And by those standards, my early life was\\nspent in extreme poverty. But we never really felt the burden of\\npoverty. You see, someone who is used to wearing\\nfine shoes will feel their absence when they don’t\\nhave them',\n",
       "  'But for us, we had never worn shoes in our\\nlives, so how would we even know that wearing\\nshoes was a big deal?.  We weren’t in a position to compare. That’s just how we lived. Our mother worked incredibly hard. My father, too.\\nHe was extremely hardworking. And he was also extremely disciplined. Every morning, around 4:00 or 4:30 AM, he\\nwould leave the house, walk long distances, visit several\\ntemples, and then reach his shop. He wore traditional leather shoes,\\nhandmade in the village',\n",
       "  'The shoes were very tough and sturdy,.  making a distinct ‘tok tok tok’ sound when\\nhe walked. People in the village used to say that they could tell the time\\njust by hearing his footsteps, \"Oh yes,\" they would say: \"Mr. Damodar is\\non his way!\" Such was his discipline. He worked\\ntirelessly, late into the night. Our mother, too, ensured that we never\\nfelt the struggles of our circumstances',\n",
       "  'But despite everything, these challenging circumstances of living\\nin scarcity never left a mark on our\\nminds..  I remember, in school, the idea of wearing\\nshoes never even crossed my mind. One day, while I was on my way to school,\\nI ran into my uncle on the way. He saw me and was surprised, \"Hey! You go\\nto school like this? Without shoes?\" So at that time, he bought me a pair of\\ncanvas shoes and made me wear them. Back then, they must have cost around 10\\nor 12 rupees',\n",
       "  \"But here's the thing, they were white canvas shoes,\\nand they would quickly get stained..  So what did I do? In the evening, after school was over, I\\nwould stay back for a while. I would go from classroom to classroom, collecting leftover pieces of chalk that\\nthe teachers had discarded. I would take the pieces of chalk home, soak them in water, mix them into a paste, and polish my canvas shoes with it, making\\nthem bright white again\",\n",
       "  'For me, those shoes were a treasured\\npossession, a symbol of great wealth..  And I don’t exactly know why, but from childhood, our mother was\\nextremely particular about cleanliness. Perhaps that’s where we inherited that\\nhabit too. Not sure how I picked up the habit of\\ndressing neatly, but it’s been there since childhood. Whatever I wore, I made sure it looked\\nproper. Back then, as you can imagine, we didn’t\\nhave any arrangements for ironing clothes',\n",
       "  'So instead, I would heat up water in a\\ncopper pot,.  hold it with tongs, and press\\nmy clothes myself. Then, I’d head off to school. That’s how I lived, and I found joy in it. We never thought about being poor, or\\njudged about how others lived, or what\\ntheir struggles were. We lived carefree, enjoying whatever\\nlittle we had, and kept working hard. Never once did we complain about these\\nthings',\n",
       "  'And all these aspects of my life, whether\\nyou call it fortune or misfortune, unfolded in such a way in politics that\\nthey started coming to light..  Because when I was taking my oath as Chief\\nMinister, TV reporters went to my village,\\nquestioned my childhood friends, went to capture videos of my home. That’s when people started asking, \"Who is this and what background\\nhe is coming from?\" Before that, very few knew much about my\\nlife. That’s just how my journey has been',\n",
       "  \"My mother possessed an innate spirit of\\ncaring for others' well-being,.  it was woven into the very fabric of her\\nbeing. She possessed knowledge of traditional\\nremedies and healing practices and would\\ntreat children with these remedies. Every morning, before sunrise, around five\\no’clock, she would start treating them. So, all the children and their parents\\nwould gather at our home, little children\\ncrying, and we had to wake up early because of it\",\n",
       "  \"Meanwhile, my mother would continue\\ntreating them with care..  This spirit of service, in a way, was\\nnurtured through these experiences. A sense of empathy for society, the desire\\nto do good for others, these values were instilled in me from my\\nfamily. I believe that my life has been shaped by\\nmy mother, my father, my teachers, and the\\nenvironment I grew up in. - There's a lot of young people listening\\nto this that are truly inspired by your\\nstory\",\n",

What can you tell to those young folks, who are struggling, who are lost in the\\nworld, who are trying to find their way, what advice could you give them? - I want to tell all young people the\\nfollowing: No matter how dark the night may seem, it is still just night, and morning is\\nbound to come. That’s why we need patience and\\nself-confidence. Yes, the challenges are real, but I am not\\ndefined by my circumstances',\n",

Difficulties are a test of endurance; they\\nare not meant to defeat me. Hardships exist to make me stronger, helping me grow and improve, not to leave\\nme hopeless or discouraged. Personally, I see every crisis, every\\nchallenge, as an opportunity. So, to all young people, I say, \"Have patience',\n",

Whatever responsibility we are given, we\\nmust pour our heart into it. We should live it with passion, enjoy the\\njourney, and find fulfillment in it',\n",

Even a wealthy person who indulges in\\ncomfort and idleness will eventually\\nwither away. Instead, he must decide, \"Yes, I may have\\nresources around me, but I must use my abilities to grow them\\nfurther.\" I must contribute more to society with my\\nown strength. Even if I am in a good position, there is\\nstill so much more to do',\n",

I have also noticed that, some people tend\\nto think, \"I\\'ve learned enough, that\\'s it.\" But one should never let the student\\nwithin them die. Learning should never\\nstop. I believe that as long as I am alive, I\\nmust have a purpose. Perhaps I exist to keep learning, to keep\\ngrowing',\n",
       "  'Now, my mother tongue\\nis Gujarati, and We were not very familiar with the Hindi\\nlanguage, nor did we know how to speak it eloquently\\nor communicate effectively..  But as a child, I used to sit at my\\nfather’s tea shop. And at that young age, I got the chance to\\nmeet so many people. And every time, I learned something from\\nthem. I observed their ways of speaking, their\\nexpressions, these things taught me a lot',\n",

       "  \"We lived among people, surrounded by them,\\nthat was just how life was..  There was a library in the village, and I\\nused to go there often to read books. Whenever I read something from the books,\\nI often found myself feeling inspired, thinking, why shouldn't I shape my own\\nlife like that? That desire was always there\",\n",
       "  'When I used to read about Swami\\nVivekananda or read about Chhatrapati\\nShivaji Maharaj, I would often wonder: how did they live?\\nHow did they build such remarkable lives? And for that, I constantly experimented on\\nmyself..  Most of my experiments were physical in\\nnature, testing my body’s limits. For example, where I lived, winters\\nweren’t too harsh, but December nights could get quite cold. But still, at night the cold would bite, it was natural',\n",
       "  'So, sometimes, I would decide to sleep\\noutside in the open,.  with nothing to cover myself, just to see\\nhow my body endures the cold. So, from a very young age, I would often\\nexperiment with my body, and uh, this became a regular thing for\\nme. For me, going to the library, reading extensively,\\nvisiting the pond, washing the family’s clothes, and swimming\\nbecame part of my routine. Swimming was my main physical activity. All of these things were deeply connected\\nto my life',\n",
       "  'Later, as I read Vivekananda, I became\\neven more drawn to his teachings..  One time, I read about Swami Vivekananda.\\nHis mother was ill, so he went to Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa\\nfor guidance. He would argue with him, debate with him. In his early days, he would often argue with him, questioning\\neverything intellectually. He said, “My mother is sick. If I were\\nearning, I could take better care of her.” Sri Ramakrishna said, \"Don\\'t bother me\\nwith all this.\" Go to Goddess Kali. She is there',\n",
       "  'Ask her\\nfor what you need.”.  And so, Swami Vivekananda went and\\nsat before Goddess Kali\\'s idol for hours, and he\\nimmersed himself into deep meditation. After a few hours, when he returned, Ramakrishna asked him, \"So, did you\\nrequest the goddess?\" Swami Vivekananda replied, \"No, I didn’t.\"\\nRamakrishna said, \"Go again tomorrow. She will fulfill your request. Ask her!\" He went the next day, and then again the\\nday after. But each time, he found himself unable to ask for anything',\n",

I didn’t ask for anything.\" To stand before the Divine Goddess and not\\nbe able to ask for anything, that moment, that experience, lit a flame\\ninside him. There was a spark in his life, and from\\nthat came the spirit of giving',\n",

So, as a child, I chose not to attend the\\nwedding. I stayed back, serving Swamiji instead. Somehow, my mind was naturally drawn in\\nthat direction',\n",

I spent time in the Himalayas, embracing\\nthe solitude of the mountains. I met many remarkable individuals along\\nthe way, some were great ascetics, people who had\\nrenounced everything. But still, my mind remained\\nrestless. Perhaps it was my age of curiosity, of\\nwanting to learn, to understand',\n",

The two teams have a epic rivalry on the\\npitch and more seriously given the geopolitical\\ntensions that you spoke to, what role do sports and cricket and football play in fostering better\\nrelations? - I think sports have the power to\\nenergize the entire world. The spirit of sports brings people\\ntogether across different nations. That’s why I would never want to see\\nsports being discredited',\n",

Now, coming to the question of who’s\\nbetter and who’s not. When it comes to techniques in sports,\\nI’m not an expert. Only those who specialize in the technical\\naspects can judge which techniques are superior and who the\\nbest players really are. But sometimes, the results speak for\\nthemselves. Just a few days ago, India and Pakistan\\nplayed a match',\n",

So another tough question, who is the\\ngreatest football player of all time? We've got Messi, Pelé, Maradona,\\nCristiano Ronaldo, Zidane\",\n",
       "  'Who do you think is the greatest football\\nplayer to have ever played?.  - It’s absolutely true that many regions\\nin India have a strong football culture. Our women’s football team is performing\\nreally well, and the men’s team is also making great\\nprogress. But if we talk about the past, back in the\\n1980s, one name that always stood out was\\nMaradona. For that generation, he was seen\\nas a true hero. And if you ask today’s generation, they’ll\\nimmediately mention Messi',\n",
       "  'Now that you’ve asked, another interesting\\nmemory just came to mind..  There’s a state in India called Madhya\\nPradesh, right in the center. There’s a district called Shahdol, a completely tribal region where a large\\ntribal community resides. I really enjoy interacting with people\\nfrom such communities, especially the self-help groups run by\\ntribal women. So, I decided to visit them and have a\\nconversation',\n",

Nearly 80 national-level players have come\\nfrom here. Our entire village is dedicated to\\nfootball',\n",

I see the growing craze for football in\\nIndia these days as a positive sign because it not only fuels passion, but\\nalso builds true team spirit. - Yeah, football is one of the great\\nsports that unites not just India, the whole world, and that, that just shows\\nthe power of what sport can do',\n",

There are so many people here, let’s walk,\\nwave, and greet them.\" In American life, it’s almost impossible for the President to walk into a crowd of\\nthousands.

He makes his own decisions, but also, he\\ntrusted me and my lead in that moment enough to have walked\\nwith me into the crowd. It was that sense of mutual trust, a\\nstrong bond between us, that I truly\\nwitnessed on that day.

I found that incredibly impressive, it showed how much he\\nhonored the Presidency, And, how respectful and deeply connected\\nhe was to America’s history. I could feel that.

But during that time, whenever someone we\\nboth knew met him, and this must have happened dozens of\\ntimes, he would say, \"Modi is my friend, convey\\nmy regards.\" That kind of gesture is rare. Even though we didn’t meet\\nphysically for years, our direct and\\nindirect communication, our closeness, and the trust between us\\nremained unshaken. - He said that you\\'re a much, tougher,\\nmuch better negotiator than he is',\n",

As for Elon Musk, I’ve known him since my\\ntime as Chief Minister. He was there with his family and children, so naturally, the atmosphere\\nfelt warm and friendly.

For example, after I took office in 2014,\\nI observed that back then, we weren’t part of many global\\ndiscussions, not like how President Trump and Doge are\\nbeing talked about today\",\n",

That’s 100 million fake or duplicate names\\nthat I removed from the system. And because of that, We saved massive amount of money. Then I introduced\\nDirect Benefit Transfer, ensuring that every rupee sent from Delhi\\nreached the rightful person without leakage. As a result, my country\\nsaved nearly ₹3 trillion that would have otherwise ended\\nup in the wrong hands',\n",

He positioned a large leaf to catch water\\nfrom one of those streams. And placed an up-side-down bowl below. So water would drip rhythmically from the\\nleaf onto the bowl. He asked me to focus only\\non the dripping water, ignoring all other sounds. Ignore the chirping birds and the soft\\nrustle of the breeze. He would place the leaf, and I would\\nmeditate there for hours',\n",

And it's not like I was chanting mantras\\nor reciting God’s name. I like to call it the divine resonance. It was by tuning into that divine\\nresonance that I learned the art of\\nconcentration. This practice slowly evolved into\\nmeditation. Sometimes, you happen to stay at a fancy\\nhotel. You get a lavish, luxurious room\",\n",
       "  \"The decor is impeccable, and you have been\\nwholeheartedly fasting..  But there's a dripping faucet in the\\nbathroom. That faint sound is enough to make a\\nluxurious room feel worthless. At times, we realize the value of\\nconcentration in life’s inner journey. We come to appreciate the difference a lit\\nbit of concentration can make. One very interesting concept comes to mind\\nfrom our scriptures.

And in general, my travels\\naround Delhi and India revealed to me some early glimpses of what felt like another world,\\nalmost like another planet, different culturally from\\nanything I've experienced before. A chaos of human interactions, out there, big dynamic\\npersonalities and characters\",\n",
       "  \"Obviously, India's composed\\nof many distinct subcultures, and Delhi represents just one slice..  Much like neither New York or Texas or Iowa alone represent America. They're all different flavors of America. On my visit, I walked around\\nand rode rickshaws everywhere, just aimlessly wandering the streets, looking to talk to people about life\",\n",
       "  \"Of course, like many places on Earth, there are always some people, especially those that\\nhave something to sell, who will at first see me as a tourist, a foreign traveler, one\\nwith some money to spend..  Like always, I avoided\\nsuch shallow interactions and went straight past the small talk to the meaningful conversations, shooting the shit about what they love, what they fear, what kind of hardship and triumph they've\\nexperienced in their lives\",\n",
       "  \"I think the cool thing about\\npeople, anywhere on Earth,.  is they quickly do see the real you, past the facades that strangers\\nput up for each other, if you're vulnerable and\\nhonest enough to let them, and I try to do just that. And I should say that for the most part, everyone was super kind\\nin the genuine human way, even when they didn't speak English, it was always easy to understand\",\n",
       "  \"Probably more than any other\\npeople's I've interacted with, in India, people's eyes,\\nfaces, body language, all communicated a lot of information,.  a lot of emotion, not reserved at all. When I travel through\\nEastern Europe, for example, in contrast, reading a\\nperson is much tougher. The meme does have some truth to it. There's often a protective layer between the heart of the\\nperson and the outside world. In India, it's all there on full display\",\n",
       "  'So I had a lot of epic conversations and interactions as I walked around Deli.  for a couple of weeks. In general, on the\\ntopic of reading people, I do believe the eyes can\\noften say more than words can. We humans are a fascinating bunch. There really is a deep, turbulent ocean behind the surface\\nwaves we show the world. In some sense, what I try\\nto do in conversations, on and off the mic, is\\nto get to that depth.

       "  'I will most certainly travel around India with my friend Paul\\nRosolie in the near future, maybe with some other friends, all around from the north\\nof India to the south..  Now allow me to also comment about one of the books that\\nfirst drew me toward India and to its deep history of philosophical and spiritual traditions. The book is \"Siddhartha\" by Herman Hesse. I first read most of Hesse\\'s\\nmajor work as a teenager, but then reread them\\nagain through the years',\n",
       "  'It first found me, \"Siddhartha,\" when I was immersed in a very\\ndifferent kind of literature.  of Dostoevsky, Camus, Kafka, Orwell, Hemingway, Kerouac, Steinbeck, and so on. Many of these explore\\nthe same human condition that puzzled me when I was a young man, and still puzzles me today even more so. But \"Siddhartha\" was my introduction to the Eastern way of\\nlooking at these puzzles. It was written by Herman\\nHesse, and by the way, please allow me this\\npronunciation of his last name',\n",
       "  \"I've heard some people say Hesse,.  but my whole life I've always said Hesse. So anyway, it was written by Herman Hesse, a German Swiss Nobel prize-winning writer during one of the darkest\\nperiods of his own life. His marriage was failing, World War I had shattered\\nhis pacifist ideals and he suffered from\\ndebilitating headaches, insomnia, and depression\",\n",
       "  'During this period, he began\\npsychoanalysis with Carl Jung, which in part led him to\\nexplore Eastern philosophies as a way to heal his fractured psyche..  Hesse immersed himself in\\ntranslations of ancient Hindu and Buddhist texts,\\nstudying the \"Upanishads\" and the \"Bhagavad Gita.\" And so the writing of\\n\"Siddhartha\" was in itself, for him, a journey that paralleled that of the\\nmain character in the book',\n",
       "  \"Hesse started writing the book in 1919 and finished three years\\nlater, experiencing an extensive psychological\\ncrisis in the middle..  The book follows Siddhartha,\\na young man in ancient India as he leaves behind wealth and comfort to search for meaning. You can feel his personal\\nstruggle in every page. Siddhartha's restlessness,\\nhis dissatisfaction with conventional wisdom,\\nhis need to find truth, the direct experience\",\n",
       "  \"Again, the book wasn't simply a philosophical exploration for Hesse, it was psychological survival..  He was writing his way out of suffering and towards his own enlightenment. I won't go into a deep\\nanalysis of the book here, but I will mention two\\nkey lessons I took away and carried with me to this day. First lesson comes from\\nthis scene in the book that to me is one of the great\\nscenes in all of literature\",\n",
       "  'Siddhartha is sitting by\\na river just listening, and in that river he hears\\nall of life, all sounds,.  all voices, all of time,\\npast, present, future flowing together as one. That scene gave me the\\nexperience and the notion that while in some grounded human sense, the linear arrow of time does exist. In another sense, time\\nis a kind of illusion, that in fact, everything\\nexists simultaneously. That our lives are both\\nmomentary and eternal',\n",
       "  \"It is hard to describe\\nthese ideas with words, I think they must be experienced\\nas personal revelations..  I'm reminded of the fish story\\nthat David Foster Wallace, another one of my favorite writers, described in a commencement\\nspeech 20 years ago. The story goes, two young\\nfish are swimming along when they encounter an older\\nfish swimming the opposite way\",\n",
       "  'The older fish nods and says, \"Morning boys, how\\'s the water?\" The young fish swim on, and eventually one turns\\nto the other and asks, \"What the hell is water?\".  The illusion of the\\nforward progress of time is water in this metaphor. As humans, we\\'re fully immersed in it, but enlightenment in part\\ninvolves being able to step back and get a glimpse at another\\ndeeper perspective on reality where all things are\\ninextricably interconnected across both time and space',\n",
       "  'Another key lesson from the novel.  that was especially formative\\nto me as a young man was that one should not\\nblindly follow others, or learn about the world\\nexclusively through books. But rather forge your own path and thrust yourself into the world where the lessons of\\nlife can only be learned by experiencing them directly. And every experience, both\\npositive and negative, mistakes, suffering, and\\neven seemingly wasted time is all an essential part of growth',\n",
       "  \"To this point, Hesse draws a distinction.  between knowledge and wisdom. Knowledge can be taught by others. Wisdom can only be gathered through experiencing the\\nfull mess of life yourself. In other words, the path to understanding isn't through rejection of the world, but through complete immersion in it. Those are my early steps\\nin seeing the world through the lens of Eastern philosophy. But many of Hesse's books\\nhad an impact on me\",\n",
       "  'I would recommend to read\\n\"Demian\" when you are younger, \"Steppenwolf\" when you are older,.  \"Siddhartha\" throughout your life, especially in moments of crisis,\\nand \"The Glass Bead Game\" if you want to take on\\nHesse\\'s magnum opus, that rigorously explores\\nthe ways the human mind and human civilization can engage in the pursuit of\\nknowledge, wisdom, and meaning. But \"Siddhartha\" is the only one I\\'ve\\nreturned to more than twice',\n",
       "  'In my own life, when faced\\nwith a difficult situation, I often return to the moment in the book.  when Siddhartha is asked\\nwhat skills he possesses, and his answer is simply, \"I can think, I can wait, I can fast.\" Let me elaborate. Indeed, for the first part, \"I can think,\" as Marcus Aurelius said,\\n\"The quality of your life is determined by the\\nquality of your thoughts.\" For the second part, \"I can wait,\" patience and waiting often is indeed the optimal decision\\nwhen facing a problem',\n",
       "  'Time does bring clarity\\nand depth of understanding..  For the third part, \"I can fast,\" when needed, being able to\\nlive and flourish with less is a prerequisite of being free, when the mind, the body, and society all are trying to put you in cages. All right, friends. Now, sadly, our time\\ntogether in this episode has come to a close. As always, thank you for being here and thank you for your\\nsupport through the years'],\n",

I think sometimes like the the levels were hundreds of times higher than the recommended uh PM PMI. Is that what it is? PMI limits. Yeah. Am I? Yeah. PMI. PM2.5. PM2.5. Yeah. Yeah. PM PM2.5. Yeah\",\n",

It would actually extend lifespan more\",\n",
       "   'Which is wild that people are living in this pollution every single day. And I think Brian, you said.  that um after you and Mike were doing the a look at the literature that it actually potentially is that pollution caused more shortening of life than cancer did. So that India might even be better off solving pollution for its country rather than trying to go after something like cancer. So what happened? Why was it so controversial? Yeah. So we we decided to go to India last year',\n",
       "   \"So yeah, we got there and it just like um as we got more and more in the Indian culture and and talked about this topic, it just became increasingly clear that it's really a representation of this more systematic problem where they're literally breathing death and everyone is so.  normalized to it that they couldn't even see it anymore. And so just like for for context on this like the the PM 2.5 is is a marker of of of a health danger\",\n",
       "   \"So, but being.  there in person, it was actually intense. Like much more than I'd imagined. When you said like they're breathing death and they're normalized to it, it makes me think about how in America you're eating death and you're normalized to it. Like that our culture is just so So yeah, I guess like a note that um this really isn't about um India's inability to solve pollution. It's about the things that are right in front of our eyes that we can't see that we learn to live with\",\n",
       "   \"And so I think within that couple days like we it was like it blew up in India like the.  whole of India was talking about this topic and from the cover of all the major publications there it became a really really big topic. Yeah. For context on this, this was actually really emotionally stressful because the the PM 2.5 levels when we were there, I think they averaged around 75 to 120 depending upon the city we were in. And that's equal to around 3 to five cigarettes per day\",\n",
       "   \"So, Mike, what would you say for you people all over the world that are listening to this? Um, how should they think about being aware of air quality and what things can they do to improve uh their health amidst air quality challenges they may face in their.  region? Yeah, I mean, so first thing I wanted to say is that this isn't isolated to India. Air quality is an issue all over the world\",\n",
       "   'got so alarmed I called my friend Kate I.  called you and I was like I think we need to cancel this trip like it is really bad. I mean, I knew that the air quality in India was bad, but like not to this level. And um so I talked to my friend and he\\'s like, \"You know what? It\\'s fine. Um the hotel we\\'re staying at has air purifiers throughout the hotel. It\\'s all monitored. It\\'s on these screens. You\\'re fine.\" And so we went there and once we\\' landed, it was just an entirely different world',\n",
