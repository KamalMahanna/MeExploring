“Chidambaram ji has admitted that this ghamandiya (arrogant) alliance has no basis, no future. We have said time and again that this INDI alliance is a picnic alliance which keeps travelling from place to place seeking to hatch a conspiracy against the BJP,” BJP national spokesperson Syed Zafar Islam alleged.

“Today, he has admitted that neither this alliance nor the Congress have any future…several wise Congress leaders have admitted that the BJP is a formidable organisation dedicated to the cause of the nation,” he added.

Adding that India had emerged strong under the NDA regime, Islam added that it was under the watch of the BJP-led government at the Centre that terrorists had been hit at their very doorsteps. It was because of the political will exhibited by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his decision to give a free hand to the country’s armed forces that India had been able to “enter and attack the very homes of terror”, he added.

“But the INDI alliance has tried to do politics on this as well…if you talk about the economy, when Chidambaram ji was finance minister, our economy was the 14th in the world…after 2014 (when the BJP formed government), it is the fourth,” Islam said.

The INDIA bloc, he added, had realised that “it had no future” and that BJP-led NDA governments would be in power “for 50 more years”.

“…the economy has become stronger, the country has become stronger…and this is all because of its determined leadership…the INDI alliance has only one objective: to put the (central) government and (PM) Modiji in the dock…but the people have stood by him…the INDI alliance has realised that it has no future…so has the congress,” he further said.
