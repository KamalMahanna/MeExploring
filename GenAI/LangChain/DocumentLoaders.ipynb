In the photograph, they stand behind a bearded jihadi who\\nstands beside the coffin of his dead relative. The coffin is covered in the Pakistani flag and wreaths\\nof red roses lie on it. The photograph has been viral on social media for days and the names of the\\nsenior Pakistani officers mourning the death of the Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist have been made public\\nby our government.\\nThis photograph, which I have looked at many times, left me stunned because of the utter\\nshamelessness it depicts. Ever since the horrendous massacre in Pahalgam, there has been a\\ncollaborative campaign by Pakistan’s military and civilian rulers to convince the world that the old\\npolicy of using jihadi terrorism as a weapon of war has ended. When the Islamist Republic’s military\\nrulers are unable to convince the world of their credentials, they usually summon English-speaking,\\nattractive civilians from well-known political families to make the case for them.\\nThis time it was Bilawal Bhutto and Hina Khar (she of the Birkin bag fame) who were tasked with\\ndenying that Pakistan has anything to do any more with jihadi terrorism. Bhutto admitted that official\\nsupport for jihadist terrorism was something that happened once but in ancient history. And\\nMadame Khar made similar claims on a British TV show, while delicately fiddling with her perfectly\\ngroomed hair and lacy white dupatta. Until Barkha Dutt asked her to state clearly if she believed\\ngroups like the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed were terrorist outfits. Instead of answering\\nthe question, she fled and where her face had been, there was a blank window for the rest of the\\nshow.\\nIf there is one thing that Pakistan has revealed, albeit unintentionally, is that it continues to nurture\\nevil, cowardly fanatics who lack the courage to fight real wars and choose instead to kill innocent\\npeople. This alone means that India won the war. The purpose of Operation Sindoor was to send\\nPakistan’s military rulers the message that their jihadi foot soldiers would no longer be able to\\nwander about India, killing unarmed civilians. This message was convincingly delivered with attacks\\non the headquarters of Lashkar-e-Taiba in Muridke and Jaish-e-Mohammed in Bahawalpur. And\\nsimilar messages were delivered to jihadist encampments in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.\\nWhere India lost, as it often does, was in countering Pakistan’s narrative with a more convincing\\nnarrative of our own. So, it has been asked far too many times not just by Pakistanis, but by\\nWestern commentators, why India had not provided proof that the massacre in Pahalgam was\\nordered by Pakistan. This emboldened far too many Pakistanis to repeat, ad nauseum, that what\\nhappened in Pahalgam was a “false flag operation”. When you live in a country that has been ruled\\nby military men for most of its existence, it is easy to believe that it’s possible for an Indian Prime\\nMinister to kill his own people just to find a reason to go to war. It cannot happen in a democratic\\ncountry. Period.\\nProof of this is that every time the Indian state has been involved in a pogrom or causing communal\\nviolence, it has been exposed and vilified. The list is too long to repeat here, but three come\\nimmediately to mind. Hashimpura in 1987, Delhi in 1984 and Gujarat in 2002. Justice may not have\\nbeen fully done, but the state has been identified as the perpetrator of violence in all three cases.',\n",

       " 'page_content': 'Mission Impossible – The Final Reckoning movie review: Tom Cruise’s last rodeo as Ethan Hunt makes a feeble appeal for a united world\\n\\nMission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning movie review: The film is an ode to Tom Cruise. In its numerous flashbacks to the previous M:I films, it underlines the times Ethan Hunt saved the world, and honours the people he loved and lost.\\n\\nDid someone switch a few vowels, maybe? In a film where so many are talking so much, that won’t be entirely, well, impossible. For, this eighth and last (or so they say) film in the M:I franchise could as easily have been called Mission: Impassable, given its tortuous course.\\n\\nThe Final Reckoning, of course, is the second half of what began as Part I in 2023. Five hours and 31 minutes later (making the two Final Reckonings the longest films in the franchise), you are still trying to care enough about the villain to hate it.\\n\\nAnd given that you have arguably the biggest movie star in the world on the other side, that should not be so hard. Tom Cruise is still out there giving it his all – and yes, doing his own stunts – kicking butt, dodging bullets, diving off submarines, dangling now not from one but two planes, almost dying not once but twice.\\n\\nAlso read – Mission Impossible Fallout review: The best Mission Impossible movie yet\\n\\nWriter-director Christopher McQuarrie spares no expense, taking the story from London underground to the Arctic Circle, Virginia’s Emergency Command Centre to South Africa’s Doomsday Vault, and some other stops in the middle. But, it must be asked, why exactly. The chase remains – like in Part I – of an Artificial Intelligence software gone rogue and dubbed the Entity, which is apparently trying to destroy the world (Ethan Hunt, that is Cruise, must take the President’s word for it, which is surely not a good starting point in a world where tech lies in bed with power).\\n\\nSurely, a simpler investment would be someone to write a counter code. But that would not leave Ethan much to do, would it? Particularly as the brains in that department are his two loyal sidekicks returning for the job, Luther (Rhames) and Benji (Pegg). Also returning is Grace (Atwell), whose pickpocketing skills that we saw in Part I are the best resource in a world running out of time.\\n\\nSo this time, Ethan’s mission is retrieving some sort of a device from a Russian submarine that crashed somewhere in the ocean bed sometime in 2012. When a poison pill developed by Luther is plugged into it, Entity would be poof!\\n\\nIf only someone would say poof! If it’s not complicated enough that Entity has brought the world to the brink of a nuclear disaster (a lot of nuclear talk here), lots of men and – hats off – women hold whispered, urgent conversations throughout The Final Reckoning about “counter-acoustic devices”, “primordial digital ooze”, “hyperbaric decompression chambers”, underwater pressure and what it does to a human body… etc etc. And this is even before Cruise gets to the Russian submarine.\\n\\nThe action inside that submarine, precariously balanced and one tip away from crashing, with water filling up and missiles floating about, dead bodies jumping up, and Ethan figuring out its many panels and chambers, is one of the most breathtaking sequences of The Final Reckoning. At the very least, it is something original in a franchise that seems to have run out of original ideas on what\\n\\nto put Ethan through – though Cruise still makes running that fiercely and hanging mid-air that fearlessly look easy. The M:I score barely makes an appearance, and those famous masks get barely a peeling.\\n\\nAbove all, The Final Reckoning is an ode to that Cruise, in its numerous flashbacks to the previous M:I films, underlining the times he saved the world, and just how jaw-droppingly, the sacrifices he made, the people he loved and lost.\\n\\nRead more – Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One movie review: Tom Cruise delivers bang for the buck thrills\\n\\nAnd if McQuarrie, who with five films got the most out of this franchise after his lead actor, is not showing Cruise in action, he has people gushing about it. “The world would be a very different place without you, or not there at all,” is one such praise, followed by many different versions of the same. People can’t help praising Ethan even seconds away from the explosion of megatons of detonators.\\n\\nEthan is supposed to be doubting his contribution, in terms of gains versus loss, and The Final Reckoning makes a feeble appeal for a united world, not divided by nationalities, more than once. That is, till the world is brought to the brink again – and saved.\\n\\nBut hey, Cruise remains one of the best people to do that still. He just needs a better world than The Final Reckoning’s to save.\\n\\nLong time back, in M:I II, Anthony Hopkins’s character tells Ethan: “Now, it’s not Mission Difficult is it… Difficult would be a walk in the park for you.”\\n\\nSo, we’ll wait for a new mission – should Cruise choose to accept it.\\n\\nMission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning Director – Christopher McQuarrie Cast – Tom Cruise, Hayley Atwell, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Esai Morales, Pom Klementieff, Angela Bassett Rating – 3/5',\n",

In its numerous flashbacks to the previous M:I films, it underlines the times Ethan Hunt saved the world, and honours the people he loved and lost.\\n\\nDid someone switch a few vowels, maybe? In a film where so many are talking so much, that won’t be entirely, well, impossible. For, this eighth and last (or so they say) film in the M:I franchise could as easily have been called Mission: Impassable, given its tortuous course.\\n\\nThe Final Reckoning, of course, is the second half of what began as Part I in 2023. Five hours and 31 minutes later (making the two Final Reckonings the longest films in the franchise), you are still trying to care enough about the villain to hate it.\\n\\nAnd given that you have arguably the biggest movie star in the world on the other side, that should not be so hard. Tom Cruise is still out there giving it his all – and yes, doing his own stunts – kicking butt, dodging bullets, diving off submarines, dangling now not from one but two planes, almost dying not once but twice.\\n\\nAlso read – Mission Impossible Fallout review: The best Mission Impossible movie yet\\n\\nWriter-director Christopher McQuarrie spares no expense, taking the story from London underground to the Arctic Circle, Virginia’s Emergency Command Centre to South Africa’s Doomsday Vault, and some other stops in the middle. But, it must be asked, why exactly. The chase remains – like in Part I – of an Artificial Intelligence software gone rogue and dubbed the Entity, which is apparently trying to destroy the world (Ethan Hunt, that is Cruise, must take the President’s word for it, which is surely not a good starting point in a world where tech lies in bed with power).\\n\\nSurely, a simpler investment would be someone to write a counter code. But that would not leave Ethan much to do, would it? Particularly as the brains in that department are his two loyal sidekicks returning for the job, Luther (Rhames) and Benji (Pegg). Also returning is Grace (Atwell), whose pickpocketing skills that we saw in Part I are the best resource in a world running out of time.\\n\\nSo this time, Ethan’s mission is retrieving some sort of a device from a Russian submarine that crashed somewhere in the ocean bed sometime in 2012. When a poison pill developed by Luther is plugged into it, Entity would be poof!\\n\\nIf only someone would say poof! If it’s not complicated enough that Entity has brought the world to the brink of a nuclear disaster (a lot of nuclear talk here), lots of men and – hats off – women hold whispered, urgent conversations throughout The Final Reckoning about “counter-acoustic devices”, “primordial digital ooze”, “hyperbaric decompression chambers”, underwater pressure and what it does to a human body… etc etc. And this is even before Cruise gets to the Russian submarine.\\n\\nThe action inside that submarine, precariously balanced and one tip away from crashing, with water filling up and missiles floating about, dead bodies jumping up, and Ethan figuring out its many panels and chambers, is one of the most breathtaking sequences of The Final Reckoning. At the very least, it is something original in a franchise that seems to have run out of original ideas on what\\n\\nto put Ethan through – though Cruise still makes running that fiercely and hanging mid-air that fearlessly look easy. The M:I score barely makes an appearance, and those famous masks get barely a peeling.\\n\\nAbove all, The Final Reckoning is an ode to that Cruise, in its numerous flashbacks to the previous M:I films, underlining the times he saved the world, and just how jaw-droppingly, the sacrifices he made, the people he loved and lost.\\n\\nRead more – Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One movie review: Tom Cruise delivers bang for the buck thrills\\n\\nAnd if McQuarrie, who with five films got the most out of this franchise after his lead actor, is not showing Cruise in action, he has people gushing about it. “The world would be a very different place without you, or not there at all,” is one such praise, followed by many different versions of the same. People can’t help praising Ethan even seconds away from the explosion of megatons of detonators.\\n\\nEthan is supposed to be doubting his contribution, in terms of gains versus loss, and The Final Reckoning makes a feeble appeal for a united world, not divided by nationalities, more than once. That is, till the world is brought to the brink again – and saved.\\n\\nBut hey, Cruise remains one of the best people to do that still. He just needs a better world than The Final Reckoning’s to save.\\n\\nLong time back, in M:I II, Anthony Hopkins’s character tells Ethan: “Now, it’s not Mission Difficult is it… Difficult would be a walk in the park for you.”\\n\\nSo, we’ll wait for a new mission – should Cruise choose to accept it.\\n\\nMission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning Director – Christopher McQuarrie Cast – Tom Cruise, Hayley Atwell, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Esai Morales, Pom Klementieff, Angela Bassett Rating – 3/5')"

But Instagram user Samveda M V has changed that with her striking performance of the Rahat Fateh Ali Khan song from the 2007 film Aaja Nachle.\\n\\nIn the video, Samveda brings the soulful melody to life using sharp, syncopated beats on the chenda, creating a unique fusion that has impressed social media users. Shared on her handle @samveda_mv with the caption “O re piya. Please do ignore the flaws,” the video has clocked 2.8 million views and over 4.3 lakh likes.\\n\\nA post shared by SAMVEDA M.V. (@samveda_mv)\\n\\nThe performance has earned Samveda an outpouring of praise. One user commented, “Woowwwww girlllllllllllllll….this made me reallllly sooo happyyyyyyy Keeeeep goinggggggg.” Another user said, “This is talent.”\\n\\nOne Instagram user wrote, “Those who liked it after seeing this should see the rest of the post as well. This will hit the first million.” A lot of other users reacted to the video with heart emojis and clapping emojis.\\n\\nSamveda regularly shares performances of her blending the classical percussion instrument with popular songs. Her skillful use of the chenda, an instrument typically played by male artistes during temple festivals and rituals, is being lauded for bringing visibility to Kerala’s folk traditions.\\n\\nRecently, a talented flautist named Mehboob, from Rajasthan, captured the hearts of many with his impromptu performance at the Raipur airport. He skillfully played a beautiful rendition of Teri Mitti by B Praak and Arko from the movie Kesari. The video quickly went viral.')"
