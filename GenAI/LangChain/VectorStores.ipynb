       " 'documents': ['All-party teams: Congress member Anand Sharma hails ‘important initiative’, party dubs them ‘diversion’\\n\\n“We’ve been restrained… It was time there was retaliation, but it was measured, calibrated, which was made clear by India… All-party teams will sensitise global opinion on Pak hand”: Sharma\\n\\nThe Modi government’s decision to send all-party delegations to foreign capitals to explain India’s position on terrorism was “an important initiative”, necessary to “sensitise global public opinion” about the role of Pakistan in the same, senior Congress leader and former Union minister Anand Sharma has said.\\n\\nSharma, the only one among the names given by the Congress that the government included in the seven delegations, will travel to South Africa, Egypt, Qatar and Ethiopia in the coming days as part of his team.\\n\\nUnderlining that the Congress had given unequivocal support to the government for whatever action it took following the Pahalgam terror attack, and stood in solidarity with the Armed Forces, Sharma told The Indian Express: “It is important to sensitise global public opinion about the situation in our region created because of decades of cross-border terrorism, (by) terrorist groups which are funded, nurtured and sheltered by the Pakistani military establishment and, in particular, the ISI. India has bled. We have paid a heavy price. We have been restrained in our responses. Very few countries could have been… It was time that there was retaliation, but it was measured, it was calibrated, which was made clear by India.”\\n\\nLike several senior Congress leaders, Sharma seemed to strike a different line from the party’s increasingly aggressive stance on Operation Sindoor. On Wednesday, Congress communications head Jairam Ramesh, who had earlier questioned the government over the party names it picked for the delegations, called the whole exercise a bid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to “divert” attention.\\n\\nAfter the 1950s, MPs from various political parties were sent in delegations to the UN in New York every October-November, Ramesh said, adding that it was Modi who ended this tradition when he became PM in 2014. “But now that he is desperate and his image globally has been shattered, he suddenly thought of such all-party delegations of MPs to visit different countries to divert attention from the tough questions he is being called to answer,” Ramesh said.\\n\\nListing the big terror attacks in India, Sharma told The Indian Express: “Even when Parliament of India was attacked, India was outraged, but still there was maturity and firmness. But the list is a long one… From Jammu to Udhampur, Pathankot, Chittisinghpora, Uri, Poonch, Pulwana and now Pahalgam. So there cannot be any equivalence between India and Pakistan. One is a promoter of terrorism – they have weaponised it as a part of their strategy – and India is a victim. It is important that the leadership of countries where our groups would be going are fully informed as to what the situation is.”\\n\\nPakistan had its backers, Sharma said, and “therefore the global community has to stand as one in the fight against terrorism”. “They cannot be selective. There cannot be an approach which has carve outs for some terror outfits in some countries. It is a global scourge. It must be eradicated. Long back we had moved a resolution against terrorism at the United Nations which some countries, including China, had prevented. There has to be coordinated action. Some actions have taken place like the FATF (Financial Action Task Force) to choke terror funding and flow of both\\n\\nresources and weapons. Much more is required to be done,” he said.\\n\\nSharma said that the all-party delegations would inform foreign countries of “India’s position and the ground realities as to how over decades these terror attacks have unfolded and the price which our people have paid”. “It would be wrong on the part of leaders of any country to think that it is only India’s problem. It is a global threat… Wherever in the world you have terrorist groups operating, they have to be neutralised. Otherwise, they pose a risk to civil societies and a threat to nation states,” he said.\\n\\nSharma, who was a Cabinet minister in the UPA government, also recalled how the Manmohan Singh government “mobilised and sensitised” the international community after the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks. “Then also not only was there an outpouring of grief but also outrage. And the world understood the seriousness… every major country stood up. In the past, our leaders – both Rajiv Gandhi and P V Narasimha Rao – requested even (BJP stalwart) Atal Bihari Vajpayee to lead a group or be part of it,” Sharma said.\\n\\nHe added that on two occasions he had travelled with Vajpayee on such trips, and these brought together “leaders of various political parties… because India belongs to all of us and India speaks in one voice when India is the victim of terrorism”.\\n\\nIn reaction to Ramesh’s claim that the all-party delegations were a “diversionary tactic” by the Modi government, the BJP said the Congress was again “belittling” the government, and hurting efforts to convey India’s strong stand against Pakistan-sponsored terrorism.\\n\\nBJP national spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP Sudhanshu Trivedi said: “The Congress is forced to make such a statement in frustration as it is not being able to ask for proof (of Indian military action). Nationalism has completely vanished from the eyes of the Congress.”\\n\\nCiting statements by not just Ramesh but also Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi, Trivedi said they seemed to be trying to outdo each other “in the race to gain popularity in Pakistan”. Ramesh’s remarks were an “insult” to all MPs, he said.',\n",
       "  'Did Love O2O star Zheng Shuang give birth to a baby with wanted Chinese tycoon after surrogacy controversy?\\n\\nLove O2O star Zheng Shuang is back in headlines after reports claim she secretly gave birth to a billionaire’s child in the US.\\n\\nPopular Chinese actor Zheng Shuang, who became a household name with the hit drama Love O2O opposite Yang Yang, has reportedly welcomed a baby with a Chinese billionaire, according to a report from Chinese news site 163.com, quoting unnamed industry insiders. Zheng’s career derailed in early 2021 after she got embroiled in a series of controversies ranging from tax evasion to surrogacy abandonment and fraud, following which the Chinese government banned her popular shows from streaming in the country. The report comes just days after Zheng was seen crying during livestreams, denying rumours and viral claims that she had become a rich man’s “mistress or surrogate.”\\n\\nAlso read: Hidden Love’s Sang siblings Zhao Lusi and Victor Ma reunite in a new Chinese show with a twist\\n\\nThe insiders who spoke to the website alleged that the actor had secretly given birth in the US, after which she was also rewarded with a luxurious villa and a limited-edition car by Ye Dianwei, a wealthy businessman who just happens to be on China’s most-wanted list. The child’s gender is still unknown, and there’s no hard proof yet, but the rumour has already taken over the internet. Back in March, following her livestream, netizens demanded Zheng prove herself, asking her to stand up and show her full body to prove she wasn’t pregnant. She refused and then, reportedly, on March 12, disappeared from the public eye, which only made the situation worse for her.\\n\\nAlso read: Hidden Love star Zhao Lusi admits ‘memory loss’ from medication on new show: ‘I can’t film dramas now’\\n\\nDays later, Fuerdai, a popular TikToker who claims to be Ye Dianwei’s son, made a startling claim on social media accusing his notorious father of cheating on his mother with Zheng, and said that his dad sent tens of millions of yuan to support the actor, who is keeping low-key in the United States. He even went as far as to claim that Zheng lives in a villa where his father has other kids as well. Ye Dianwei, according to reports, has been warned by the Chinese government and would be arrested immediately if he sets foot in the country. Industry insiders claim the Swords of Legends star started dating him in 2024 after struggling financially because of lack of work after she was blacklisted in China, and her debts in the US were piling up fast.\\n\\nZheng’s career was at its peak after she starred in globally popular shows like Love O2O, Swords of Legends, Meteor Shower, Hi Venus, and more. Later, Netflix bagged the rights to a few of her C-dramas, which skyrocketed the actor to global fame. However, in 2021, her career was suspended in China, and her shows were banned. Her reputation, jobs, and brand deals vanished overnight. Zheng was accused by her ex-boyfriend, Zhang Heng, of abandoning two surrogate babies in the United States. According to Zhang, he was left stranded in the US with the babies while the actor returned to China and provided photos and birth certificates to back his claim. A leaked phone recording, where Zheng’s parents allegedly suggested giving the babies up for adoption, made the situation worse.\\n\\nAfter she was blacklisted in China, Zheng moved to the U.S., where she reportedly owes more than 200 million RMB (~$27.8 million), according to KbiZoom. She’s also been trying to sell her $21 million villa in the U.S. So far, neither Zheng Shuang nor Ye Dianwei has commented on these new\\n\\nclaims.',\n",
       "  'Opinion Ashoka University professor Ali Khan Mahmudabad has moral ambition and courage. Ashoka University does not\\n\\nIt is difficult to figure out exactly why Ashoka University acts in the way that it does. Can it be that when it speaks of an education in the liberal arts, it has in mind merely a transfer of the protocols and materials in use in American colleges without any commitment to freedom of expression?\\n\\nThe arrest of Ali Khan Mahmudabad by the Haryana Police based on a law book of colonial provenance, its sanskritised nomenclature notwithstanding, has taken India to a particularly new low. Ali has been arrested for a series of social media posts in which he has praised the choice of women to explain Operation Sindoor to the country, implying that it represents a recognition of gender and India’s religious diversity. He also called out the role of the Pakistani state in abetting cross-border terrorism that has killed innocent Indians for long. Mahmudabad then went on to engage a section of his countrymen, asking them to address the issue of mob lynching and the state’s use of bulldozers as a form of justice. It is difficult to conceive of anything more patriotic. In fact, he has done seva to his country.\\n\\nMahmudabad’s arrest has drawn attention to Ashoka University, which he adorns with his international education, a family history of being in the public life of this country for over three generations and, above all, dedication to educating the young. His rectitude is reflected in the restraint in his response to charges made against him by the Women’s Commission of Haryana. It is as strong in their rejection as it is dignified. If I am asked to cite an instance of moral ambition shown by an individual in recent times, it would be this.\\n\\nMoral ambition, a term coined recently by the Dutch writer Rutger Bregman, is the passion for making the world a better place. By exhorting his country to aim at being a place where there is gender equality and religious pluralism, he exudes such ambition. Leaving the world a better place is so transparently intuitive a goal that it stuns the imagination to find that it has not been shared by his university, Ashoka. In more than one post on social media, it has distanced itself from Ali’s post, hailed the actions of India’s armed forces and clarified that it is cooperating with the authorities. The last is an egregious declaration, and whatever the university is signalling, it is not moral ambition for sure. After all, it was clear why the authorities, first the Haryana Women’s Commission and then the police, were after him. Does Ashoka University consider what he did illegal? If it did not, it should have just left the law to take its course without the political signaling implicit in its post that it wished to be seen as being on the right side of the Indian state. By proclaiming its willingness to cooperate, it is implying that Ali has violated some section of the law or norm of accepted social conduct, which he has not.\\n\\nAs someone who productively spent close to a decade at Ashoka University, I observe its slide with some disappointment. It had a spectacular start in rapidly launching undergraduate instruction in the humanities and the social sciences to world-class standards. It was able to recruit students from a wide range of backgrounds from the length and breadth of the country and then offer the most deserving among them substantial need-based financial aid. Faculty were given, and probably still are, full freedom to teach what they consider appropriate to their discipline. In fact, in this the administration showed itself to be more catholic than the faculty in some departments. However, all this pales beside the university leadership’s repeated response to pressure, whether actual or perceived it is difficult to tell, from the government and its agencies.\\n\\nSpread over close to a decade, in four instances that have reached the national press, it has either caused the exit of its faculty or publicly distanced itself from the state’s clampdown on their freedom. In all instances, its faculty had shown itself to be critical of some aspect of the functioning of the government of the day. We do not have to agree with what they had said, and I do not in all cases, to see that they were engaged in the recognised business of a university professor and had violated no law of the land. Ironically, the very presence of the faculty involved in all these cases shows Ashoka as having succeeded in choosing persons with moral ambition, going beyond mere academic activity to engage with the world in a critical way, which is the very idea behind offering an education in the liberal arts. But the University showed itself without similar ambition when it failed to see their activity in the way that it did.\\n\\nIt is difficult to figure out exactly why Ashoka University acts in the way that it does. It cannot be that its worldly-wise leadership is unaware that clamping down on the freedom of expression does not earn it the admiration of its students. The young adore the rebellious. Or can it be that when it speaks of an education in the liberal arts, it has in mind merely a transfer of the protocols and materials in use in American colleges without any commitment to freedom of expression? This can hardly be reassuring as many of them have recently caved in to Donald Trump’s ugly impositions.\\n\\nPerhaps the University should reflect on our past, which shows India as a society in which, through literature or in life, there was glorification of those who spoke truth to power. From Mirabai to Kannagi, many of them were women, and they all had moral ambition. If Ashoka has any, it will stand by young Ali Khan now.\\n\\nThe writer is an economist',\n",
       "  \"Opinion A fund crunch in the US, an opportunity for India\\n\\nThis may be a once in a lifetime moment for India to reap a rich harvest in pursuit of the country's ambition to become a world-leader in science\\n\\nOver the past few months, I have watched, with profound anguish, the foundations of the knowledge economy in the United States, the jewel in its crown and the envy of the world, being systematically dismantled. My own university, a symbol of excellence in transformational science, is engaged in a veritable battle for survival. While I am immensely proud of our position in standing up for our values and principles, the consequences of this resistance are painful, not least for young scientists whose careers are vaporising before their eyes. At the same time, I have been watching how other wealthy countries, especially in Europe, are announcing plans to feast on the rich pickings of scientists in the US who are looking to other countries to continue their work. France, for example, through the Aix-Marseille University’s Safe Place for Science programme, is offering positions and support to US researchers. Former French President François Hollande has introduced a bill to recognise refugee status specifically for scientists.\\n\\nIt dawned on me that this may be a once-in-a-lifetime moment for India to reap a rich harvest in pursuit of the country’s ambition to become a world leader in science. To do so, India would need to recognise that high-quality science is the result of the confluence of a number of key factors, the most important being the scientists themselves, equipped with the right skills and driven by the hunger to generate knowledge. This scientist needs the right environment, typically in research institutions, where they can flourish, often collaborating with others and being mentored by more experienced scholars. And finally, we need the money to pay for the scientists, for creating the environment and for the actual research that will be conducted. In my reckoning, India has both the environment and the money, and the current moment offers the country a historic chance to replenish and enrich its knowledge economy.\\n\\nSome may be perturbed by the suggestion of using Indian funds to attract scientists from abroad rather than invest in scientists already in India. While that is certainly not my intent, the fact is that scientists in the US, many of whom have completed their foundational training in India, dominate the list of laureates of the most prestigious science prizes, such as the Nobel, Lasker, Brain and Breakthrough Prizes. Even if there is some truth to the gripe that these top prizes are rigged in favour of Western scientists, there is no denying that the dramatic scientific discoveries of the past five decades, which have transformed almost every aspect of our daily lives, have emerged from the\\n\\nlaboratories of scientists in the US. Something special about the scientific environment in the US appears to facilitate the leapfrog opportunity for these young scientists to become stars, and recruiting them may bring some of that gold dust to Indian institutions.\\n\\nI identify at least two strategies for India to respond to this opportunity.\\n\\nThe first is to fund the ongoing research being conducted in India that is funded by the US government institutions. The abrupt freeze on international research by the National Institutes of Health, for example, has grave implications for some of these projects, not only in relation to the scientific outputs but also healthcare. Let us not forget that while these studies are funded by the US, they involve patients in India and their implementation is being carried out by Indian scientists and field research teams in the country. Here is an opportunity for India to take full ownership of these studies by providing bridge funding to the institutions to complete this ongoing research, for the benefit not only of people in the country but also as a contribution to science.\\n\\nThe second strategy is a dramatic expansion of the current Indian government’s VAIBHAV and VAJRA fellowship programmes to attract diaspora and foreign scientists for collaborative research with Indian institutions and build strong international research networks. The first batch of VAIBHAV fellows was selected in early 2024, with a total of about 75 diaspora scientists expected to participate over three years, supported by an outlay of approximately Rs 80 crore. Now is the time to expand the scope of these programmes, going beyond short-term visits to India to relocating permanently to the country, increasing the amounts of start-up funding and resources to enhance the competitiveness of the offers, implementing actions to enable a transparent mechanism for awarding these fellowships and enabling complete freedom to pursue their research. All these actions would also greatly benefit the country’s science ecosystem.\\n\\nNone of this will happen without additional money, of course, and while the primary funder for these strategies will necessarily be the government (as is already the case in India and most other countries), there is obviously an opportunity for the several philanthropic foundations that operate in India, some of which have already been playing marquee roles in supporting science through substantive donations to leading Indian institutions. The Indian Philanthropy Report 2025 documents how private spending on the social sector reached Rs 131,000 crore in 2024, and is expected to accelerate to 10–12 per cent over the next five years, largely driven by family philanthropy.\\n\\nTime is short, especially for the research that is already in progress and is threatened with abrupt cessation as a result of Trump’s policies. Those of us who believe that India’s development is contingent on it realising its aspirations to become one of the leaders of the global knowledge economy must act now.\\n\\nThe writer is the Paul Farmer Professor of Global Health at Harvard Medical School\",\n",
       "  'In reciprocal move, India places curbs on Bangladesh exports to North-East and abroad\\n\\nReadymade garments to cotton yarn face restrictions, fish, edible oil spared\\n\\nIndia decided Saturday to place restrictions on Bangladeshi products being exported to North-East India and overseas. This appeared to be a reciprocal move given that Dhaka had been imposing non-tariff barriers on Indian exports to Bangladesh.\\n\\nThe Directorate General of Foreign Trade, under the Ministry of Commerce, issued a notification Saturday. It said the restrictions will not apply to import of fish, LPG, edible oil and crushed stone to India from Bangladesh. The restrictions will also not apply to Bangladesh exports to Nepal/Bhutan transiting through India, it said.\\n\\nThe curbs come a month-and-a-half after Bangladesh interim government chief adviser Muhammad Yunus said in Beijing that North-East India is “landlocked” and Dhaka is the “only guardian of the ocean for all this region” — he made the remark while seeking “extension of the Chinese economy”.\\n\\nIndia decided to impose port restrictions on specified Bangladesh exports to India across all land customs stations (LCSs) or integrated check posts (ICPs) in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram and through Changrabandha and Fulbari in north Bengal.\\n\\nThe products include readymade garments, wooden furniture, plastic and PVC finished goods, fruit-flavoured and carbonated drinks, baked goods, snacks, chips and confectionery items, and cotton yarn among others.\\n\\nSeparately, in the case of readymade garments, port restrictions are expected to apply to Bangladesh exports to India across all land ports, permitting imports only through Kolkata and Nhava Sheva seaports.\\n\\nThis is one of the strongest pushbacks from Delhi against Dhaka since the ouster of the Sheikh Hasina government in August last year.\\n\\nThe rationale for the restrictions in the North-East is that India had earlier permitted export of Bangladesh goods via all LCS and ICP and through seaports without undue curbs.\\n\\nBut Bangladesh continues to impose port restrictions on Indian exports, particularly at LCSs and ICPs bordering North-East states despite the issue being raised at all relevant meetings for a long time now.\\n\\nDelhi’s assessment is that industrial growth in the North-East suffers a triple jeopardy due to imposition of unreasonably high and economically unviable transit charges by Bangladesh, denying in practice North-East’s access to the rest of India for its manufactured goods and sourcing inputs notwithstanding the bilateral transit agreements.\\n\\nDue to landport restrictions by Bangladesh, North-East states suffer from lack of access to the Bangladeshi market to sell locally manufactured goods, restricting market access to primary agricultural goods only. Bangladesh, on the other hand, has free access to the entire North-East market, creating an unhealthy dependency and stymying growth of the manufacturing sector in the North-East, according to Delhi’s view.\\n\\nTo support local manufacturing in the North-East, India decided to impose port restrictions across all LCSs/ICPs in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram on specified Bangladesh exports to\\n\\nIndia, targeting those commodities that can be locally manufactured.\\n\\nPort restrictions will also apply to LCS Changrabanda and LCS Fulbari (both are in north Bengal) to avoid re-routing whereby Bangladesh exports can similarly traverse the Siliguri Corridor to reach the North-East, giving Indian states a “level playing field” and an “impetus to competitively manufacture”.\\n\\nThe targeted list of items – from garments to juice, furniture to cotton yarn – will be reviewed periodically to ensure that fair and equitable growth is facilitated in the North-East states in line with the government’s schemes aimed at the purpose.\\n\\nOn the readymade garments port restrictions that are expected to apply to Bangladesh exports to India, Delhi’s rationale is that Bangladesh has recently imposed port restrictions on export of Indian yarn via land ports allowing Indian yarn exports only via seaports. This, Delhi feels, has ostensibly been done in response to demand by Bangladesh textile mills even though the land route offers the quickest and cheapest access of yarn to the readymade garment industry in Bangladesh.\\n\\nBangladesh exports over USD 700 million worth of readymade garments annually to India.\\n\\nAccording to Delhi, Dhaka cannot cherry-pick terms of bilateral engagement solely to benefit itself or take India’s market access for granted.\\n\\nSources said India is willing to engage in discussions but it is Bangladesh’s responsibility to create an environment free of rancour.\\n\\nShubhajit Roy, Diplomatic Editor at The Indian Express, has been a journalist for more than 25 years now. Roy joined The Indian Express in October 2003 and has been reporting on foreign affairs for more than 17 years now.

Desilting work contracts worth nearly Rs 1,100 crore are under the scanner.\\n\\nMithi River is an 18.64-km long seasonal river having both residential slum pockets and industrial patches alongside, and plays the role of a natural stormwater drainage channel for Mumbai, carrying excess water during the monsoon. But, over the years, it has been used by local residents to dump garbage, sewage, and industrial waste, polluting it to a significant level. After the 2005 Mumbai flooding, the authorities realised the issues with the Mithi River, and the government put in efforts to clean the sludge from the riverbed to ensure uninterrupted water flow. It has been alleged that massive corruption occurred in the desilting work sanctioned and carried out by the BMC.\\n\\nEOW SIT officials conducted preliminary inquiries for months and came across various financial irregularities pertaining to contracts for desilting the river between 2021-22 and 2022-23. These irregularities were related to the transportation of sludge and its dumping on the ground. EOW found that the contractors submitted nine fake Memorandums of Understanding (MoU).\\n\\nThe Mumbai police named BMC assistant engineer Prashant Ramugade; deputy chief engineers Ganesh Bendre and Prashant Tayshette; Deepak Mohan, Kishore Menon, Jay Joshi, Ketan Kadam and Bhupendra Purohit, the directors of Acute Designing, Kailash Construction Company, NA Construction, Nikhil Construction, and JRS Infrastructure, respectively, as the accused.\\n\\nBilal Shaikh, Inspector, EOW SIT, is the complainant in the case. EOW officials said more First Information Reports (FIR) are likely to be registered in the future. Sources said the EOW will issue notices to the accused for questioning soon.\\n\\nSources said ED officials are closely scrutinising the financial dealings and transactions related to the desilting work contracts.\\n\\nMithi River desilting scam\\n\\nAs per the Mumbai police FIR, initially filed with the Azad Maidan police, the accused BMC officers allegedly misused their positions for wrongful financial gains. The FIR further alleges that they conspired to defraud the BMC financially by including terms and conditions as mentioned in the contract agreement regarding the silt pusher machine and the multipurpose amphibious pontoon machine. They allegedly colluded with Mohan Menon of Matprop Company, Joshi of Virgo Specialties, Ketan Kadam and other partners and directors of Vodar India LLP, and contractor Bhupendra Purohit, among others.\\n\\n“The accused BMC officer of the Storm Water Drains (SWD) division of the Municipal Corporation, without verifying the authenticity of the dumping sites mentioned in the false and fabricated MOU submitted by the directors of the contractor companies Acute Designs, Kailash Construction Company, N A Construction, Nikhil Construction Company, JRS Infrastructure and others, provided and helped contractors take disadvantage,” the EOW officer stated in the FIR.\\n\\nAlso, the FIR added that officials of the SWD division caused financial loss to the BMC by approving bills based on fake documents related to the weighbridge and log sheets.\\n\\nThe EOW’s FIR also mentioned that the accused Deepak Mohan and Ketan Kadam of Matprop, told the contractors that Jay Joshi is the owner of Virgo Specialties and Kadam is looking after the work of Voder India LLP. They allegedly told the contractors that the Matprop firm will ink the MoU, but the machinery rental agreement will be with Virgo Specialities Pvt Ltd and Voder India LLP, and the two-year rental of the machinery will cost Rs 8 crore.\\n\\nAfter the negotiations, it was decided to pay a rental of up to Rs 4 crore for two years. This is how Matprop, in collusion with the BMC SWD division officials, forced the contractors to go to these two companies without the MoU and got more financial benefits from the contractors, EOW officials stated in the FIR.\\n\\nWhat the EOW has found so far\\n\\nThe SIT under EOW has already arrested two middlemen – Ketan Kadam and Jay Joshi – in the case. Joshi is the owner of Virgo Specialties Pvt Ltd, and Kadam is from Voder India LLP. EOW officials seized electronic devices from Kadam and copies of posting orders of officials in the BMC’s Storm Water Drains (SWD) department.\\n\\nThe police have also received notes of entries of money received from the contractors of the Mithi River desilting work. Investigators suspect that these are entries of the commissions. SIT officials have also found raw draft copies of BMC tenders from the seized devices.\\n\\nAccording to the EOW, Kadam was a hotelier before 2019 and he had no experience in desilting work. However, since 2020, he has been involved in inking deals involving Matprop Company with various contractors for the disputed silt pusher machine and multipurpose amphibious pontoon machine and in making rental agreements for the said machinery on behalf of Virgo Specialties Pvt Ltd and Voder India LLP, even though they are not related, making the contractors pay his own salaries and forcing them to accept the rental by demanding more than the cost of the machine.\\n\\nAlthough Kadam is not a partner or director in Virgo Specialties or Voder India, he has signed the rental agreement as an authorised person and has kept the information about why he signed such agreements hidden.\\n\\nThe EOW also found some records in coded language in the seized electronic device.',\n",
       "  'From Silicon Valley to sovereign stacks: The global AI power shift\\n\\nAs large language models struggle with bias and multilingual performance, small and community-driven AI projects offer an alternative path.\\n\\nWritten by Navanwita Sachdev\\n\\nJust as there can be no single human being without bias and context, there probably can never be an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model that keeps everyone content. Because challenges remain in ensuring fair representation in AI training data and balancing government involvement. As these developments unfold, the future of global technology governance will depend on collaboration, innovation, and a commitment to inclusivity across linguistic and cultural boundaries.\\n\\nAs per The Algorithm, at RightsCon, a digital rights conference held in Taiwan, civil society organizations from around the world, including the US, discussed the loss of US government funding for global digital rights work. Discussions included observations that American big tech companies, which have users far beyond US borders, seem to be shifting in willingness to engage with and invest in smaller user bases, particularly non-English-speaking communities. So much so, that policymakers and business leaders in Europe are reconsidering their reliance on US-based tech, giving rise to a new interest in developing homegrown alternatives, particularly for AI.\\n\\nFor example, India is preparing to roll out an indigenous Indian web browser, with three homegrown projects selected for productization under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology’s (MeitY) Indian Web Browser Development Challenge (IWBDC). Union Minister for Electronics and Information Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw, selected three projects, submitted by Zoho Corporation, Team PING, and Team Ajna, to build a browser that meets India’s security, language, and usability needs.\\n\\nOpinions bound that the US President Donald Trump administration’s shift in policy has pushed the US toward “competitive authoritarianism”, a claim by some political scientists. Many are seeing the loss of US government funding as a significant setback for global digital rights work.\\n\\nSocial media content moderation systems already use automation and large language models (LLMs), but they are failing. For example, they haven’t been successful in detecting gender-based violence in India, South Africa, and Brazil. The problem is, if platforms rely more on LLMs for content moderation, the problem of detecting gender-based violence will likely get worse. After all, LLMs are being used to moderate other content, even though they themselves are moderated poorly.\\n\\n“LLMs are helpful for flagging patterns, detecting spam, and offering human moderation teams a scalable assist but they’re not yet nuanced enough for judgment-based calls. The trade-off between over-moderation and under-protection is real. You need models that can learn domain-specific boundaries and cultural nuances or which can mitigate bias. This again brings us closer to the value SLMs could offer,” says Ruban Phukan, CEO of GoodGist, an agentic AI company.\\n\\nThe problem primarily arises because many AI systems are trained primarily on English-language data, particularly American English. A study found that ChatGPT performed worse in Chinese and Hindi than in English and Spanish for health-related queries. Multilingual language models perform poorly with non-Western languages.\\n\\n“As LLMs get better at detecting the nuances of human language, they will become better tools for content moderation. However, they cannot be left alone, since the amount of false positives are likely to skyrocket, we’ve seen this happen with Meta’s new implementation of AI for moderation in Facebook,” explains JD Raimondi, Head of Data Science, at Making Sense.\\n\\nSome support community-driven AI approaches, such as small language models and chatbots. Indian startup Shhor AI, has developed a content moderation API for Indian vernacular languages. Other solutions include Mozilla’s volunteer-led effort to collect training data in languages other than English. Lelapa AI is building AI models for African languages.\\n\\nAccording to Raimondi, SLMs have come to level the field for most companies where they can access a language model without a huge investment in equipment or relying on other providers for a fraction of the price, albeit at the cost of a lower (but still acceptable) performance.\\n\\n“They are also easier to train and adapt, cheaper to deploy and change, and simpler to distribute. Furthermore, until hardware gets better, SLMs are the ones that are likely to be present in mobile devices running without an internet connection,” he adds.\\n\\nWe also have to remember that shifts in technology are bound to occur all the time.\\n\\nSumedh Nadendla, a venture capitalist at Pacific Alliance Ventures, reminds that the definition of small and large changes with time as technology improves. “What is large today might be small twenty years from now. The DeepSeek-V3 model has 671 billion parameters with a context length of 128,000 right now. I think that’s just going to be the lower base in 20 years. What is LLM today might be SLM 20 years from now,” he says.\\n\\nAlso, AI has become the new competitive theme of global tech. The recent Paris AI Summit involved major power plays, an indication that AI has definitely become a source of geopolitical competition more than a cause for international cooperation and multilateral governance. France’s President Emmanuel Macron clearly used the summit as a platform to depict France as the AI leader in Europe and the star host of the summit.\\n\\nHowever, European companies that are spending big on Gen AI need to start showing returns on their massive outlays by next year, because risk investors who have paid sky-high prices to join the market boom can lose patience.\\n\\nAndy Yen, CEO of Proton, recently said that Trump’s policies are accelerating Europe’s push for tech sovereignty. In fact, several countries have announced “sovereign AI” initiatives, looking to keep their data away from the US. The European Union appointed its first commissioner for tech sovereignty, security, and democracy in November. Europe is working on the “Euro Stack,” a digital infrastructure initiative. The Indian government has developed “India Stack,” a digital infrastructure system that includes Aadhaar. Dutch lawmakers recently passed motions to reduce dependence on US tech providers.\\n\\nBut are governments the right parties to decide which languages and perspectives should be included in AI training data?\\n\\n“Yes..but carefully,” replies Phukan. “Governments should help ensure transparency, access to diverse language datasets, and create safety regulations. But heavy-handed involvement can risk slowing innovation. A supportive policy environment that promotes open-source SLMs, especially in underrepresented languages, could be transformative. We need guardrails, not gatekeepers,” he reiterates.\\n\\nGovernment involvement in language model development could be problematic if it determines which languages or perspectives are prioritized.\\n\\nAccording to a study, minimal regulation for AI never maximizes actual consumer welfare. For example, the study points out that China and the EU use top-down command and control approach\\n\\nto AI regulation, while Russia and the UK use bottom-up industry self-regulation based on AI ethics. Thus, the AI policy for these countries cannot be the same. The study advises that under high or low foreign competition, stringent AI regulation should be chosen, while under intermediate foreign competition, looser regulation is recommended.\\n\\nSo, both context and global perspective are significant for an AI model. And we might have no choice but to work on one forever as the human race continues to evolve.',\n",
       "  'While styling Kiara Advani’s bikini shot in War 2, there was only one-word brief, recalls Anaita Shroff Adajania: ‘Hot’\\n\\nKiara Advani has given a bikini shot for the first time in War 2. Stylist Anaita Shroff Adajania recalls Kiara was in great shape and totally free in her body during the shoot.\\n\\nWhile anticipation was sky-high for a glimpse of Hrithik Roshan and NTR Jr.’s dynamic on-screen pairing in the War 2 teaser that dropped online yesterday, but what truly caught the internet off guard was Kiara Advani’s debut in a bikini. Her confident walk along a poolside in a neon lime-green bikini sent social media into a frenzy, with fans and fashion enthusiasts alike praising her poise and physique. The scene, which is already making waves, marked a significant style moment in her career.\\n\\nThe look was curated by India’s leading fashion stylist, Anaita Shroff Adajania, who reflecting on the process, said, “This was my first time styling Kiara for a film, and the brief was hot. I’ve styled swimsuits for many films before, and I’ve always approached them with a more casual mindset. To me, the real vibe I wanted for her was how we are as women on a beach: happy, relaxed, totally ourselves in a bikini, without overthinking how small or big it is. That kind of ease is beautiful.”\\n\\nAlso Read | Hrithik Roshan and NTR Jr’s War 2: Whopping budget, world tours to Kiara Advani’s first bikini shot.

I really believe it’s so much cooler and far more sensual when you’re just you,” she added.\\n\\nPraising Kiara’s commitment, Anaita insisted that it was the actress’s confidence and preparation that made the look so impactful. “Kiara really put in the work to give us exactly the look we were going for. I wanted her to feel so at ease that she didn’t have to think about which way she was turning or what she was doing, just totally free in her body. And wow, did she deliver! That incredible body? All her. I just had the absolute pleasure of showing it off.”\\n\\nWar 2 is the sixth installment in the YRF Spy Universe Produced by Aditya Chopra and directed by Ayan Mukerji, and is set to hit cinemas on August 14th.',\n",

       "  'Google I/O 2025: As Google pushes AI Mode in Search, will it help ease antitrust pressure?\\n\\nAt this year’s I/O developer conference, Google’s AI search-related announcements largely echoed its arguments in the ongoing antitrust remedies case.\\n\\nGoogle’s experimental AI Mode feature in Search, that enables deeper and more complex search queries, is now rolling out to all users in the US to start with. The announcement came during the opening keynote of Google’s annual I/O developer conference held in Mountain View, California on Tuesday, May 20, and focused on showing off the company’s latest advancements in AI, Android, augmented reality, and more.\\n\\nOver the coming weeks, users in the US will start to see a new AI Mode tab in Google Search and as a button in the search bar within the Google app.\\n\\nWhile Google on Tuesday drew the curtains back on several new AI products, including the company’s most advanced image and video generation models, AI Mode in Search was the big news to come out of I/O 2025 for two main reasons.\\n\\nGoogle has long dominated the search engine market, shaping the structure of the internet through the rise and fall of content driven by its search engine. But this dominance has come under threat recently with the rise of AI chatbots that have emerged as a viable alternative to looking up information online.\\n\\nIn this context, AI Mode is billed to be the future of Google Search as it moves away from showing users a list of blue links on a web page to providing an end-to-end search experience. However, Google is also facing a prominent antitrust challenge where the US government is pushing for the company’s search business to be broken up after a district court ruled last year that Google had an illegal monopoly of the online search market.\\n\\nAI Mode is powered by a custom version of Google’s Gemini 2.5 frontier model. “AI Mode is where we’ll first bring Gemini’s frontier capabilities, and it’s also a glimpse of what’s to come,” Elizabeth Reid, vice president and head of Google Search, said in a blog post.\\n\\nSearching in AI Mode is different from the typical search on Google as users can dive deeper into the web by asking follow-up questions and finding hyper-relevant content that matches their search query, according to Google. In order to display more helpful responses with web links, AI Mode relies on a query fan-out technique, where AI breaks down the search query into sub-topics and further initiates a multitude of search queries on the user’s behalf.\\n\\nAt I/O, Google also announced new capabilities of AI Mode that will become available to approved users under Google Labs in the coming weeks and months.\\n\\nOne such feature is Deep Search, where AI Mode uses the same query fan-out technique to issue hundreds of searches and gather information across sources in order to generate an ‘expert-level’ research report with citations. This entire process will take minutes, Google claimed.\\n\\nWith Search Live, users can have a back-and-forth vocal conversation with the AI chatbot about what they see on their phone screen or through their phone’s camera. AI Mode will also come with certain agentic capabilities. For instance, when a user asks to book tickets or make restaurant reservations in AI Mode, it will kick off a query fan-out process by scanning several sites and presenting the user with various options.\\n\\nAI Mode will also provide a better shopping experience for users by showing them products and product details in an easy-to-browse panel, along with a virtual try-on feature, AI agent-driven price tracking, and autonomous checkout. This suggests that Google is going toe-to-toe with challengers like OpenAI which recently rolled out its own shopping update to ChatGPT.\\n\\nIn addition, AI Mode will also have the capability to analyse datasets and real-time information to generate graphs, charts, and other visualisations.\\n\\nDuring the Google antitrust search remedies trial, AI prominently featured in the arguments made by both sides.\\n\\nThe US Department of Justice (DOJ) essentially argued that Google’s new AI search products were just another way to lead users to its search engine and thereby extend its dominance of the online search market. It also warned that Google would come to dominate the AI space, the same way it has dominated the search market, if the court did not take any action.\\n\\nGoogle, on the other hand, argued that there is growing competition in AI by pointing to the successes of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and others. It called witnesses like Eddy Cue, an Apple executive, who suggested that AI was shrinking the antitrust threat posed by Google in search. Cue’s testimony, however, tanked Google parent Alphabet’s stock by eight per cent after he revealed that search volume to its Safari browser (which runs on Google’s search engine) had declined for the first time in 22 years.\\n\\nTo reassure shareholders on the threat posed by AI chatbots, Google quickly issued a statement saying that overall queries in Search have continued to grow, and that users are accessing its search functionality in different ways.\\n\\nAt Tuesday’s I/O event, Google’s announcements largely echoed these arguments. It re-emphasised that “there’s been a profound shift in how people are using Google Search” with more than 1.5 billion people using visual search via Google Lens every month. “In our biggest markets like the US and India, AI Overviews is driving over 10 per cent increase in usage of Google for the types of queries that show AI Overviews,” it said.\\n\\nHowever, the accuracy of AI-generated search results is still under question as large language models (LLM) are prone to hallucinations. There are also concerns that Google may further eat into click-through rates as it leans more heavily on AI-generated search results. This would be bad for publishers and content creators who rely on traffic from Google Search.\\n\\nIn terms of privacy, AI search engines could increase user tracking to gather more detailed feedback in order to improve search results. For instance, AI Mode has a personalised context setting which enables it to pull information from other connected Google apps like Gmail to show tailored results. However, Google has said that this will be an opt-in feature, and that users can choose to connect or disconnect the apps with AI Mode at any time.',\n",
       "  'Priyadarshi Pulikonda: ‘I love playing the vulnerable man on screen’\\n\\nCourt actor Priyadarshi Pulikonda on his boy next door image, how low-budget films still have an audience and celebrating his Telangana identity.\\n\\nPriyadarshi Pulikonda’s recently released legal drama Court: State Vs. A Nobody is currently the talk of the town. The film, which dwells on the intricacies of a young romance getting entangled in legal drama, sees the 35-year-old play junior advocate Surya Teja.\\n\\nThe Hyderabad-based actor admittedly has a knack for lesser-known stories. Mallesham (2019), which follows the life and work of the titular Padma Shri-winning entrepreneur and weaver from rural Telangana, is an example. While he is known for his comic timing in films like Jathi Ratnalu (2021), it is the vulnerability that he brings to his characters — Gajula Saayilu in Balagam or Surya Teja in Court — which has made him an emerging face from the Telugu filmscape. In this interview, Priyadarshi speaks about his journey as an actor, what excites him and why vulnerability is his greatest strength. Excerpts from a conversation:\\n\\nYou come from a family of teachers. How did acting happen?\\n\\nI was a curious child and was drawn to moving images. I was seven or eight when I watched Sagara Sangamam (1983). When you see a great film, it makes you feel powerful. That film made me want to be an actor. Learning cinema at the University of Hyderabad helped. I think people who don’t come from the film fraternity should learn how films are made and how they work. I later joined a company that did visual effects for Telugu films, which was a refresher course for me. I came into films when digital filmmaking was nascent. At the time, people were making films by renting a Rs 2,000 camera that gave a feature film-like output.\\n\\nHow do you choose your roles?\\n\\nThere is no definitive process. Films like Mallesham (2019) or Pelli Choopulu (2016) spoke the language of youngsters. I relate to such stories. Essentially, if a story strikes a chord, I will take it up.\\n\\nAlso Read | HIT 3 movie review: An effective Nani sees red in this bloody but rocky action drama\\n\\nIn your films, you embody the boy next door image. Is that a conscious choice?\\n\\nYou always want to be the boy next door. That is where the quality of being relatable comes from. I love playing the vulnerable man on screen.\\n\\nWhat is it about playing vulnerable men that attracts you?\\n\\nTheir representation in cinema is limited. These are the men who are fighting their own battles just by living their lives. My struggles as an artiste have made me a vulnerable person. As an artiste, you always hold a mirror to yourself and the world. So, playing such characters is satisfying.\\n\\nIn Mallesham and Balagam, your characters come from rural Telangana. Is playing characters from the region important to you?\\n\\nThe Telangana identity is important to me. Growing up in Hyderabad and following writers who come from the hinterland help me portray such characters. People like Venu Yeldandi from Sircilla\\n\\nand Tarun Bhaskar from Warangal inspire me. Besides that, it feels nice to speak the dialect.\\n\\nCourt is a leap. You play an urban advocate. How did that happen?\\n\\nI met the writer (Ram Jagadeesh) when I was working on a different project. We got talking about the intricacies of the POCSO Act. I think when stories are personal, they get creative and more empowering. Jagadeesh had one such story which he developed into an amazing legal drama. There was a certain integrity to my character.\\n\\nThe Telugu film industry is known for its big budget films. Is there space for niche low-budget films? Would you want to do an RRR (2022)?\\n\\nEarlier, the perception was that low-budget films have no star-value but that is slowly changing, as the story becomes the star. When we look at Court, the returns it has brought was purely because it was a rooted, personal film. For the film industry to thrive, we need all kinds of cinema — big- and low-budget films. I do want to be part of a film like RRR, but I need to be deserving enough to do so. The practical aspect is whether I will be able to pull the weight of such a film in terms of revenue, considering I come from the indie scene. I do not want my producers to go back with losses. But, RRR, yes, some day.\\n\\nWould you want to work in other regional film industries in India?\\n\\nI look forward to it. When you see a Kannada film like Garuda Gamana Vrishabha Vahana (2021) or a Malayalam film like Sookshmadarshini (2024), or even some of the Tamil films, you understand that there are interesting perspectives.\\n\\nAlso Read | Chiranjeevi was ‘humiliated’ when stars like Sivaji Ganesan were ignored at National Awards while Raj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar were celebrated: ‘It was like an insult’\\n\\nWhat are your upcoming projects?\\n\\nI am doing a film called Premante with a new director Navneet Sriram. It has an interesting take on love and relationships. Mitramandali by debutant director Vijay is a light, humorous film. I think all my new projects are from people who come from diverse backgrounds.',\n",

Special emphasis will be placed on the use of byproducts for rural livelihood generation, they added.\\n\\n“The cow shelter will not only provide a secure home for thousands of cows but will also be a hub for innovation in organic farming, gau-based industry, and rural entrepreneurship. We are working to ensure that development is rooted in our cultural identity,” said Singh.\\n\\nHe added that such projects represent a synthesis of tradition and progress. The use of solar energy and rainwater harvesting will reduce the facility’s environmental footprint, making it a model of green infrastructure, said Singh.',\n",
       "  'In Manipur, famed Shirui Lily festival becomes first real test of normalcy\\n\\nThe Shirui Lily Festival is held in sites in Ukhrul town and Shirui village in Ukhrul district, where the Tangkhul Naga community is in the majority.\\n\\nOn Thursday, popular Imphal-based Instagram handle, Imphalgram, uploaded a video of a “road trip” to the hill station of Ukhrul, located around 80 kilometres from the city. The video shows the creators travelling by scenic hill roads, passing by markets, and security personnel and vehicles — ubiquitous in the state for the past two years — to reach Ukhrul. There, they visit different sites of the Shirui Lily Festival, one of the two major tourism festivals organised by the Manipur government, scheduled to begin on May 20. This is the first time since the ethnic conflict broke out in the state in May 2023 that the festival is being held.\\n\\nAfter visiting the sites in Ukhrul with officials of the Manipur tourism department and meeting district administration and police officials, the video shows the creators driving back to Imphal in the evening and signing off: “Thank you for the company, Ukhrul Police.” The comments below immediately jump to the question of security and safety: “Can we go through roadways; is it safe; do we need to take a chopper?”\\n\\nThroughout the conflict, Meiteis and Kuki-Zos have been unable to safely move in areas where the other community is in the majority. The Shirui Lily Festival is held in sites in Ukhrul town and Shirui village in Ukhrul district, where the Tangkhul Naga community is in the majority. But to get there, Meiteis and other residents of the state’s central Meitei-majority valley, which is surrounded by hill districts, need to travel through at least three pockets of Kuki-Zo settlements.\\n\\nThe last instalment of the festival in 2022 saw a footfall of around 2.19 lakh, drawing visitors from different states and parts of Manipur. But the largest number of visitors were from the Meitei-majority valley.\\n\\nThis time, the festival is being organised with a budget of Rs 6.3 crore. Pooja Elangbam, director of the Manipur tourism department, said that the Imphalgram creators were among “influencers” and bloggers from different communities in the state invited to the site as part of a “rigorous social media campaign” to build confidence that the journey will be safe.\\n\\n“When we had our first organisational committee meeting on April 2, it was decided to constitute a security committee headed by the DGP. He assured us that the police, BSF and Army will be present along the way, and we are coordinating with the Ukhrul Superintendent of Police to ensure that the journey is safe. So far, no problems have been reported. I have been going to Ukhrul from Imphal every week, and we haven’t faced any issues… Provisions are being made; how many people finally attend the festival will probably depend on the first couple of days,” she said.\\n\\nA moment of panic arose this week when a statement by an organisation named Kuki Zo Village Volunteer-Eastern Zone warned Meiteis against crossing Kuki-Zo areas to attend the festival. However, the Manipur Police swiftly issued a statement that no such organisation exists, and assured security for the free movement of people for the festival. The Kuki-Zo Council, based in Churachandpur, also distanced itself from the statement. Last week, Manipur DGP Rajiv Singh himself made a two-day visit to oversee security arrangements.\\n\\nOn Saturday, the Manipur police lodged an FIR against the president of Kuki Students’ Organisation, Delhi, for allegedly making a video threatening Meiteis. “All necessary security arrangements shall be made to ensure security of people attending the Shirui festival,” the police\\n\\nsaid.\\n\\nUkhrul DC Asish Das said the administration has made different “strategies” to address the security issue. “There are areas where the community (Kuki-Zo) feels a little apprehensive about the movement of the other community. We have had meetings with locals in those areas to build their confidence, and they have assured support and cooperation. At a senior level, we have also had meetings with all civil society organisations of the Kuki-Zo community, and they have extended their cooperation. We are also deploying heavy forces of the Army, SSB, BSF and the Manipur police, who will put ROPs (road opening parties) along the highway. On top of that, if anybody feels apprehensive about travelling by themselves, we will provide convoys at particular timings by clubbing together a few vehicles so that people can travel without fear,” he said.\\n\\nThe festival will be held over five days and includes concerts every night, a literature event, a beauty pageant, a cooking competition and cultural performances.\\n\\nSinged by the conflict, tourism has taken a nosedive in Ukhrul and the aim is also to boost the local economy, the DC said.\\n\\nNingkharun Shangh (28), a resident of Shirui village and the president of the Shirui Youth Club, said that of 500-odd households in the village, around 100 operate homestays while around 300 set up camping facilities for tourists.\\n\\n“Tourism completely stopped during the conflict, which affected all these people. So far, some people have contacted us asking for accommodation, and villagers are making arrangements. Around 150 have gotten bookings so far, we’ll have to wait and watch to find out how many people arrive. On our part, we are preparing in full swing for all the events, and locals from the village are busy working on things like setting up the stages,” he said.\\n\\nMany people in the area set up homestays and small hotels after the festival started in 2017. One of them is 33-year-old Wungmatem Nayo, who established dormitory-style rooms in 2019.\\n\\n“Business has really been affected and we have hardly had any visitors. Most people who come to the festival are usually from Imphal, but I don’t think they will come. I’m not expecting many visitors this time,” he said.',\n",
       "  'Opinion Three-year minimum legal practice requirement narrows the path to judiciary, could also worsen pendency\\n\\nIn its bid to ensure competence, the Supreme Court’s three-year practice mandate inadvertently reinforces structural inequities while doing little to address the deeper crisis within the judiciary\\n\\nWritten by Samayeta Bal\\n\\nOn 20 May, the Supreme Court reinstated a mandatory three-year legal-practice requirement for fresh recruits to the lower judiciary. This verdict traces back to the All India Judges Association vs Union of India judgment delivered in 1993, which was later modified by the Shetty Commission, and the three-year mandate was done away with. Ostensibly aimed at ensuring courtroom readiness, the verdict overlooks a harsher reality — that it erects further barriers in a system already riddled with myriad problems.\\n\\nThe Bar Council of India, in 2024, released a circular providing guidelines for a minimum stipend to junior advocates, with Rs 20,000 per month for those in urban areas and Rs 15,000 for those in rural areas. Yet, most junior advocates still get exploited by senior advocates and do not receive even half of the recommended stipend. For many fresh graduates, especially those from rural or lower-middle-class families, such rates barely cover rent, food, or loan repayments. In this context, the three-year mandate becomes not just a professional threshold but an economic quagmire. Those who cannot rely on family support or side income simply cannot afford to practise continuously at the Bar. This raises a critical concern about equity, and not just for those coming from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, but also for women, who might take career breaks due to caregiving responsibilities. The judgment, by codifying “years at the Bar” as a sole stamp of readiness, confers an unspoken subsidy on the financially secure and sidelines talented candidates who cannot weather this low-income slog.\\n\\nIn All India Judges Association vs Union of India (2002), the Supreme Court observed the need for practical experience but did not make it binding, resulting in judicial service rules varying widely across states. The 2025 judgment’s principal merit of the three-year practice requirement stems from the above case and is intended to ensure practical competence among newly appointed judicial officers. But it invites scrutiny: does reinstating a rule nearly a quarter-century old adequately align with contemporary legal education reforms? The Bar Council of India’s 2020 guidelines already require law schools to ensure five internships over five years across various legal settings. Law universities therefore incorporate experiences with trial courts, senior advocates, NGOs, and legal aid centres that expose students to real-world litigation processes far earlier than in previous decades. Additionally, moot court competitions, mock trials, and clinical legal education further sharpen advocacy and adjudicative skills — all of which have become staples in many institutions. Thus, to presume that only experience can impart practical competence is to ignore how law schools have evolved to produce more practice-ready graduates than ever before.\\n\\nThe Court’s decision also sidesteps the deeper structural issues fuelling the already alarming pendency of cases in India’s courts. As per the National Judicial Data Grid, over 50 million cases are currently pending across various levels of the judiciary. Simultaneously, the India Justice Report 2025 revealed that 33 per cent of judicial positions in high courts and 21 per cent in lower courts remain vacant. By reinforcing a rigid three-year practice requirement, the Supreme Court has effectively shrunk the already limited pool of applicants, thereby aggravating an institutional bottleneck. In the 1997 judgment L Chandra Kumar vs Union of India, the Supreme Court warned that “justice delayed is justice denied”; by mandating three years of low-paid practice, the Court\\n\\ntoday risks deepening that delay. This ruling may delay recruitment cycles, leave vacancies unfilled longer, and ultimately worsen the pendency crisis that already threatens the credibility of India’s justice delivery system.\\n\\nIn its bid to ensure competence, the Supreme Court’s three-year practice mandate inadvertently reinforces existing structural inequities while doing little to actually address the deeper crisis within the judiciary. It imposes an economic filter that sidelines talented aspirants who lack the financial cushion to survive low-paying litigation work, further shrinking an already narrow pipeline. It also discounts the transformation of legal education, which offers rigorous practical training long before graduates step into courtrooms. By privileging an arbitrary tenure over measurable skills, the ruling risks slowing recruitment, worsening pendency, and re-entrenching privilege—all while offering no guarantee of improved judicial quality. Therefore, only by ensuring that talent, not privilege, determines who holds the gavel will the bench reflect the full mosaic of Indian society and deliver timely, representative justice to all.\\n\\nThe writer is an advocate and a Legislative Assistant to Members of Parliament (LAMP) Fellow, 2024–25',\n",

       "  'Gujarat Hardlook: How an exercise to redraw Ahmedabad’s three police jurisdictions is expected to solve the jurisdictional puzzle for its residents\\n\\nTo ease the confusion of the residents and reduce the burden of “accountability without responsibility” of police personnel, the boundaries of Ahmedabad city, Ahmedabad Rural, and Gandhinagar have recently been rationalised. Here is how it would impact traffic, VIP movements, and local administration\\n\\nPicture this: Someone you know gets involved in an accident. The site of the mishap is on a key road passing through the heart of a bustling metropolitan city. You approach the nearest police station, only to be told that the jurisdiction of the area where the accident took place lies with another police station, situated on the city’s outskirts several kilometres away.\\n\\nOr this: You are a resident of an upscale housing society in the city. But although you are part of the same RWA WhatsApp group as your next block neighbour, both of you have to approach different police stations in the event of a burglary or police verification of tenants.\\n\\nWith the boundaries of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) expanding over the years, this was a possibility with a number of roads, circles, and townships in the city as well as the neighbouring Capital of Gandhinagar until very recently.\\n\\nEarlier this month, though, five years after the boundaries of the AMC expanded to 480.88 square kilometres in 2020, the rationalisation of police jurisdictions was completed.\\n\\nThe process took 18 months of deliberations among the chiefs of three police jurisdictions, governing Ahmedabad — the financial capital of Gujarat, the surrounding rural district, and the administrative capital, Gandhinagar.\\n\\nThe rationalisation of police jurisdictions, at first glance, may appear to be just another delayed bureaucratic exercise but there is a lot more to it. It not only has several elements one would expect to find in international negotiations, such as redrawing of borders and exchanging of enclaves, but is also significant for the people residing in these areas who have traditionally been struggling with overlapping police jurisdictions. The challenges can range from obtaining permissions —from police verification for documents and rental agreements to nod for protests and functions — to emergency related help in the event of an accident, besides traffic management and even road closures for VVIP movement. One of the biggest changes, as per the notifications issued mid-May, is that the Ahmedabad City Police’s jurisdiction now covers the entire area within the Sardar Patel Ring Road along with the Ring Road itself apart from service other roads, and all the circles, which are a part of it.\\n\\nWhile several outer areas in the north and west have been handed over to Ahmedabad Rural Police, internal areas, earlier controlled by Gandhinagar Police, have been taken from them. Ahmedabad Rural Police and Gandhinagar Police have also exchanged enclaves among themselves.\\n\\nThough its full effect remains to be seen, for now, several police officers and personnel The Indian Express spoke to believe that the exercise would help ease some of the pressure that came from the confusion around jurisdictions, besides freeing them of the burden of “accountability without responsibility”.\\n\\nVaishnodevi Circle: A Microcosm\\n\\nPerhaps the biggest bone of contention and the most complicated of junctures that needed resolution — a microcosm of the entire issue — was Vaishnodevi Circle. Located at a key juncture with all three police forces — Ahmedabad City, Ahmedabad Rural and Gandhinagar — having some jurisdiction, the circle faced a host of issues, including in terms of police patrolling. Resolving issues that ranged from traffic (the area is a highway) to security (it houses a major temple) besides medico-legal cases coming to the hospital here were major challenges for the officers. The circle is also complicated at ground level with an underpass and an overpass crossing each other at the intersection.\\n\\nAt Vaishnodevi Circle, named after the eponymous temple near it, the SP Ring Road meets the Ahmedabad–Gandhinagar Highway (NH 147). It is built in three levels — a roundabout at the ground level for local traffic, a flyover for vehicles heading towards Gandhinagar, and an underpass for traffic on the SP Ring Road. Add to this mesh of roads the multiple jurisdictions governing them, and one has a complicated situated at hand.\\n\\nThe centre of the circle used to fall under the jurisdiction of Adalaj Police Station (PS) of Gandhinagar, which was 8.2 km away. Now, it has been given to Sola Police Station of Ahmedabad City, at a distance of 5.6 km.\\n\\nThe area north west of the circle, including KD Hospital, which is inside the Ring Road, was under Bopal PS of Ahmedabad Rural, which is 18 km or a 30-minute drive away. It has now been given to Sola PS.\\n\\nAccording to the notification, now the jurisdiction of Gandhinagar police will begin after the edge of Vaishnodevi Circle towards the Capital city and will include one-third part of the overpass as well, but no section of the underpass.\\n\\nEven though the Vaishnodevi Circle itself has wholly been included in the jurisdiction of Ahmedabad City police, it is still divided between two police stations.\\n\\nThe section of the underpass that exits the Vaishnodevi Circle up to Apollo Circle is part of Chandkheda PS while the rest of the underpass, all the way up to Bhadaj circle, is with Sola PS.\\n\\nFor the traffic police personnel from Gandhinagar, having to relinquish this circle came as a relief.\\n\\nAnother case of three overlapping jurisdictions was that of 900-acre Adani Shantigram Township, which was divided between Adalaj, Santej and Bopal police stations. In fact, separate blocks of Water Lily society, located inside Shantigram, were also divided between two police stations. “Since both Bopal PS of Ahmedabad City as well as Santej PS of Gandhinagar are far away, but Adalaj PS is just 10 minutes away, the entire township has now come under the latter’s jurisdiction,” said Gandhinagar SP Ravi Teja Vasamsetty.\\n\\nResolution for Ring Road\\n\\nAround 18 months ago, while the police administration of the three jurisdictions discussed the rationalisation of boundaries, the Gujarat Home Department supported the move. A senior police officer familiar with the developments said, “This proposal is one-and-a-half-year old. Ahmedabad City Police Commissioner GS Malik had chaired a meeting and asked for the stakeholders’ opinion, and it was done on the insistence of Minister of State, Home, Harsh Sanghavi. He felt that people shouldn’t face jurisdictional issues.”\\n\\nOn the ideology change, a prerequisite for this rationalisation, the Superintendent of Police (SP) for Ahmedabad Rural, Om Prakash Jat, said, “The jurisdiction doctrine has changed from survey numbers falling in various areas to defining area markers like the Ring Road, which is now the boundary of the Ahmedabad City Police.” In layman terms, earlier, jurisdictions were planned on the basis of specific land survey numbers falling under a particular Revenue Department area. This predisposition has now been changed to allow greater flexibility in terms of changes in the interest of better management.\\n\\nTo better define the limits of the Ahmedabad City Police, the entire SP Ring Road has now been placed under its jurisdiction. This included the annexation of various areas under the Sarkhej, Bodakdev, Sola, Chandkheda, Airport, Naroda and Narol police stations, which include the city outskirts.\\n\\nSharing an example, Gandhinagar SP Vasamsetty said, “The survey number of Shree Balaji Wind Park is of Gandhinagar but it is physically located inside the Ring Road (in Ahmedabad). Many residents in the area believed their area fell under Chandkheda PS in Ahmedabad City but they were actually part of Adalaj PS in Gandhinagar. Now, the entire area has been given to Chandkheda PS.” Interestingly, the villages of Bhat and Koteshwar, which are inside Ring Road, and were administered by Gandhinagar police, have come under Ahmedabad City Police now.\\n\\nSimilarly, a third major route, the National Expressway 1, also goes through Ahmedabad. The area near its origin point, where it crosses the Ring Road, has now been clearly defined. The road and the overpass till the edge of the Ring Road now fall under Ahmedabad City Police. Further, parts of Shilaj, Makarba and Bopal areas, earlier under the jurisdiction of Sarkhej PS in Ahmedabad City Police, have been given to Bopal PS in Ahmedabad Rural, since they lay beyond the Ring Road. Also, Jetalpur and Chosar villages, earlier under Narol PS of Ahmedabad City, have been given to Aslali PS of Ahmedabad Rural Police.\\n\\nTale of three villages\\n\\nAn enclave is a portion of territory completely enclosed by another. An example of this at the international scale is when, in November 2015, a total of 51 erstwhile Bangladeshi enclaves in India and 111 former Indian enclaves in the neighbouring country were physically transferred to each other.\\n\\nA similar predicament, in terms of police jurisdiction, existed for three villages in Central Gujarat. Bopal PS of Ahmedabad Rural had, within its jurisdiction, the villages of Lapkaman, Khodiyar and Lilapur, situated 16 km, 19 km and 22 km, respectively, away from it. There are several other villages under Gandhinagar Police that lie between Bopal PS and these villages. While Khodiyar and Lilapur villages were added to Adalaj PS, Lapkaman village now falls under Santej PS of Gandhinagar Police.\\n\\n‘Accountability even without responsibility’\\n\\nOne of the major reasons for putting the entire Ring Road under the Ahmedabad City jurisdiction was to manage heavy traffic, coupled with VVIP movement and security bandobast. With some parts of Ring Road falling under Ahmedabad Rural and Gandhinagar, but others under the City Police, conflicts arose in dealing with accidents cases as well.\\n\\n“There was accountability even without responsibility,” said a traffic officer of Ahmedabad City Police, adding, “Due to divided jurisdictions, in the event of accidents or traffic jams, people used to call the Ahmedabad City Police. When told that the issue came under the jurisdiction of the Rural Police, people would think the police are shirking from work. So, when rationalisation was suggested, we decided to accept responsibility for the Ring Road. The commissioner has also agreed to sanction more posts for the city traffic police for the enhanced jurisdiction.”\\n\\nThe cross-jurisdiction tended to lead to delayed response time and further distress for accident victims. The disparity in manpower between Ahmedabad City Police and the two other smaller\\n\\npolice forces also played a role in city police subsuming more areas. One of the challenges before the Gandhinagar Police was managing VVIP bandobast. A local officer, whose jurisdiction included parts of the city, said, “We don’t have as much manpower as the city (Ahmedabad). We have a constant stream of dignitaries who keep coming to Gandhinagar and they usually have events scheduled in Ahmedabad as well. Having to cover routes even in Ahmedabad city proved to be very challenging. The rationalisation will help ease some of this pressure.”\\n\\nGujarat is the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi while the entire corridor between the two cities, which required the maximum resolution, falls under the Gandhinagar Parliamentary Constituency of Union Home Minister Amit Shah.\\n\\nAhmedabad City Commissioner of Police (CP) Gyanender Singh Malik spoke to The Indian Express on the impact he hopes this rationalisation will have on the people. “Earlier, there were issues of jurisdiction, especially pertaining to road accidents. People would invariably come to the city police stations. When such cases took place on the outskirts, we had to send them to Bopal or Aslali or to Gandhinagar. People were feeling harassed. That is why we felt the need to get this done for the convenience of the citizens,” he said.\\n\\nOn the security issue, Malik said, “During the VVIP bandobast, the issues of coordination arose because in certain spots, you would have jurisdiction of Ahmedabad City, then it would become Rural, then again City, and, in some places, parts of Gandhinagar as well. That is also why we proposed that the entire SP Ring Road and its service lanes be given to Ahmedabad City Police as it is the ideal benchmark to demarcate the city.”\\n\\nAfter the last expansion of Ahmedabad city in 2020, the city limits stretched from 464 sq km to 480.88 sq km. According to the Urban Development and Urban Housing Department’s June 18, 2020 notification, the limits of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation were expanded with inclusion of Bopal-Ghuma area along with village panchayats of Chiloda-Naroda (city) and Kathwada. The Bopal-Ghuma municipality is divided into Sarkhej, Jodhpur, Bodakdev and Thaltej wards.\\n\\nThe AMC limits also included some 150 survey numbers (identifiers for a chunk of government land) such as villages of Sanathal, Visalpur, Aslali, Geratnagar, Bilasiya, Ranasan and Khodiyar — the areas along the Ring Road.\\n\\nThe government notification said “… having regard to the population of the areas, the density of the population therein, the revenue generated for local administration, the percentage of employment in non-agricultural activities and the economic importance of the areas, it is considered necessary to include certain areas in the existing local limits of the Municipal Corporation of the City of Ahmedabad.”\\n\\nThe AMC had also demanded inclusion of Zundal, Khoraj, Amiyapur, Sughad and Koteshwar but these were made a part of Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation (GMC). In 2022, plans were floated to include Nandoli village in Kalol taluka of Gandhinagar district, near Shilaj and Bhadaj, under the AMC jurisdiction. However, it still remains on paper, AMC officials stated. Prior to 2020, the expansion was done in 2008 when around 180.01 sq km area was added on the western side of the city and 79.66 sq km area added on the eastern side, taking the total area to 464 sq km. In 2006, municipalities of Bodakdev, Makarba, Nava Odhav, Nikol, Vastrapur, Nava Naroda, Thaltej were included in AMC. Ahmedabad’s area remained at 190.84 sq km from 1990 to 2006.\\n\\nAMC officials said the residents of the villages and gram panchayats initially had inhibitions against being included in Ahmedabad city limits, majorly due to higher property tax and the 40 per cent deduction of plot area for civic services during redevelopment for properties within Town Planning (TP) schemes and the double deduction of 20 per cent applied to gram panchayat areas. However, since inclusion of these areas under AMC, the civic body has been focusing on upgrading infrastructure, including road networks, public transport, water supply, drainage systems, and solid waste management leading to higher allocation of budget each year.\\n\\nAdditionally, social infrastructure is also being upgraded with the inclusion of schools, anganwadi centres, health centres, swimming pools, libraries, gymnasiums, gardens and parks among others.',\n",

While the publication wasn’t able to determine the exact improvement the new feature will bring to the table, the code hints that it will replace Smart Action and Smart Reply.\\n\\nWhen enabled, the new Magic Action feature shows a new button which may have a custom animation when it appears or is clicked.\\n\\nSimilar to Smart Actions, it looks like the new feature will use the built-in Notification Assistant Service, which is part of the Android System Intelligence app. The report also states that Magic Actions will most likely use Gemini AI models to generate these actions. For example, if you get a message saying that your flight has been delayed or cancelled, Magic Action may give you a quick way to call the airline’s customer service despite the notification not having such information.\\n\\nApart from the much rumoured functionality, Google is also reportedly working on bringing AI powered notification summaries like iOS along with Gmail like bundled notifications that helps users better manage their alerts.',\n",

       "  \"Paresh Rawal’s unceremonious exit, Akshay Kumar’s lawsuit, Priyadarshan and Suniel Shetty clueless: Is the team doing Hera Pheri with fans?\\n\\nHera Pheri 3 has been in the making for 10 years. Since then, it's changed four directors, and Akshay Kumar has walked out and back into the threequel twice. Is the film in trouble again or is this all a marketing gimmick?\\n\\n“Ye Baburao ka style hai” memes flooded the internet as Paresh Rawal walked out of Hera Pheri 3 last week, making fans wonder if the film will be shelved yet again. This was the closest the comedy threequel came to go on floors in the 10 years since the idea was first conceived. Akshay Kumar as Raju, Suniel Shetty as Shyam, and Paresh Rawal as Baburao, were all onboard along with the director of the iconic first part from 2000, Priyadarshan. Here’s a timeline of the doomed threequel…\\n\\nEven though the Hera Pheri sequel, Phir Hera Pheri (2006), ended on a cliffhanger, the film wasn’t renewed for a threequel for nine years. In 2015, Hera Pheri 3 was launched by producer Firoz A Nadiadwala, but with a twist in the tale. While Rawal and Shetty reprised their roles, Akshay Kumar was nowhere to be seen as Raju. Kumar, at a new turn in his sensibilities as an actor, was going through a career shift by turning to more socially conscious cinema like Airlift and Rustom, both of which released in 2016.\\n\\nConsequently, a new plot device of ‘Duplicate Raju’ was woven into the script by director Neeraj Vora, who also wrote the first part, and wrote and directed the sequel. Dostana duo Abhishek Bachchan and John Abraham claimed to be Raju, much to the confusion of Shyam, Baburao, and the fans. Vora was all set to helm the threequel.\\n\\nAbraham mentioned in an interview with the Times of India that he’s unaware of the film’s development. He claimed that Bachchan has walked out, but he’d be open to playing Raju once Hera Pheri 3 goes on floors again. The film wasn’t taking off due to financial constraints. Later that year, Vora went into coma after a massive stroke, and passed away, leaving the film’s future in uncertainty.\\n\\nWith Vora’s death, the plot device of ‘Duplicate Raju’ got eliminated as well. In May, it was announced that Masti and Dhamaal director Indra Kumar will take over the directorial duties. Much to the fans’ delight, it was announced that Akshay would return as Raju in Hera Pheri 3, which would be an adventure comedy, on the lines of Indra’s subsequent hit, Total Dhamaal (2019). Akshay was looking for a return to the comedy genre with films like Hera Pheri 3 and Housefull 4 (2019).\\n\\nHera Pheri 3 was supposed to go on floors in 2020, and release in 2021, but the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdowns stalled the process.\\n\\n2022 – As Indra Kumar walked out of the sequel citing creative differences with Akshay, the actor followed suit, returning to his brand of socially conscious cinema like Raksha Bandhan and Ram Setu. After the success of Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, Nadiadwala signed the director-actor duo of Anees Bazmee and Kartik Aaryan for Hera Pheri 3. Rawal also confirmed the development and said the film would go on floors the following year. At the HT Leadership Summit, Akshay claimed that while he wants to make Hera Pheri 3 work, he wasn’t satisfied with the creative changes.\\n\\nIn February, news broke out that Akshay has acquired the rights of Hera Pheri 3 from Nadiadwala, agreed to reprise his role of Raju in the threequel, and enrolled his Bachchhan Paandey director Farhad Samji as the captain of the ship. Samji even shot an announcement promo with the three actors, which hasn’t been released yet. In March, Sanjay Dutt also confirmed he’s joined the film’s cast.\\n\\nIn January, Akshay confirmed while promoting Sky Force that he’d start Hera Pheri 3 next year. While shooting for Priyadarshan’s horror comedy Bhoot Bungla, he approached the director and convinced him to helm the threequel. On the occasion of Priyadarshan’s birthday on January 30, Akshay announced the director has agreed to return to the franchise, and will be taking it forward instead of Samji.\\n\\nIn an interview with The Lallantop in April, Rawal confessed playing Baburao has been a trap because the audience finds it difficult to appreciate Rawal in serious roles. He even revealed that after Phir Hera Pheri, he approached Vishal Bhardwaj and R Balki to cast him in extremely opposite roles because he wanted to get out of that image. However, he also confirmed Hera Pheri 3 would start next year, and that he doesn’t want to hamper the franchise.\\n\\nIn May, Rawal confirmed his exit from Hera Pheri 3, claiming no creative differences with Priyadarshan. He said he just doesn’t see himself as part of that franchise today. On Tuesday, reports claimed Akshay is all set to sue Rawal, his co-star of several hit films, for Rs 50 crore for breaching his contract. Priyadarshan also backed Akshay, and claimed he and Akshay had no clue about Rawal’s exit. Suniel Shetty also echoed the same. However, in an interview with Mid-Day on Monday, Rawal claimed he’d informed all three about his decision and Priyadarshan even tried to convince him.\\n\\nAlso Read — Priyadarshan reacts to Akshay Kumar sending legal notice to Paresh Rawal for sabotaging Hera Pheri 3: ‘Paresh didn’t inform us’\\n\\nSo, what’s the truth? Has Rawal indeed walked out of Hera Pheri 3 so unceremoniously, just because of a creative burnout? And has Akshay really taking Rawal to court? While there are conflicting versions out there, a reliable source close to the actor-producer confirmed to SCREEN that it may very well be a marketing gimmick.\\n\\n“After Akshay spoke of his exit from Hera Pheri 3 at the summit three years ago, the Hera Pheri fan army broke the internet. They’re just trying to recreate the same excitement now, with Rawal’s exit,” said the source, adding, “I’m not denying what Akshay was feeling then and Paresh ji is feeling now about the creative disagreement or burnout, but they’re just using those true feelings to build an illusion around the film that it’s not happening.”\\n\\n“Once the teaser, that they shot way back in 2023, is out, the fans are going to forget about these marketing gimmicks and lap up the reunion they’ve all been waiting for. Some harmless hera pheri doesn’t hurt, especially when it’s in favour of the actual Hera Pheri and its much-awaited return,” said a trade analyst on the condition of anonymity.\",\n",

Janhvi turned heads in a bespoke blush pink Tarun Tahiliani couture, handcrafted all the way from Banaras—an Indian city with a rich cultural heritage—that added a modern touch to the traditional lehenga with a ghoonghat and sculpted, structured design in the mix, which fans believe is a tribute to none other than the late Sridevi.

According to Vogue India, Janhvi’s outfit is a one-of-a-kind creation by designer Tarun Tahiliani, made from real tissue fabric. Her voluminous custom-made skirt and corset top were woven in Banaras, and the structured silhouette was infused with a “hand-crushing technique” that gave the outfit an airy yet rich feel, “almost like poetry in fabric,” as one bystander put it.\\n\\nA post shared by SCREEN (@ieentertainment)\\n\\nFor the event, Janhvi was styled by Rhea Kapoor. The soft blush pink colour palette of the lehenga gave major modern-Indian-princess energy. A matching drape flowed from her shoulder like a ghoonghat, while the pleated skirt flowed dramatically behind like a small train, long enough to abide by the Cannes 2025 dress code. This year, to control the red carpet rush, the film festival introduced a few strict rules, including a ‘no nudity policy’ and no voluminous dresses, aimed at reducing red carpet time to avoid rush and clashing. Janhvi sealed the look, drenched in layered pearl necklaces, small earrings, and a touch of floral garland. Her hair was done in a sleek low bun, and she completed her makeup with a dewy light pink tone and winged eyeliner.\\n\\nJanhvi Kapoor at Cannes film festival n pic.twitter.com/zY1TTYNNNa\\n\\n— Jeet (@JeetN25) May 20, 2025\\n\\nAlso read: Janhvi Kapoor’s boyfriend Shikhar Pahariya joins Khushi Kapoor, Karan Johar and Ishaan Khatter at Cannes for Homebound premiere\\n\\nStraight out from his royal stint in the Netflix series The Royals alongside Bhumi Pednekar, Ishaan Khatter wore a custom Gaurav Gupta, a rich textured maroon velvet jacket paired with black trousers featuring Gupta’s signature structured style, and completed the look with black sunglasses.

       "  'The 90m club in men’s javelin: As Neeraj Chopra breaks barrier, a breakdown of an elite group in athletics\\n\\nLate Friday night in Doha at the Diamond League, the rather exclusive 90m club in men’s javelin throw found not one, but two entrants. First, off his third attempt, India’s Neeraj Chopra achieved a long-standing dream. He had been knocking on the door for ages but finally he broke it down with a mammoth 90.23m throw to become the 25th man in history to achieve the feat. But there was to be another late twist. Germany’s Julian Weber got ticket No 26 into the list, throwing 91.06m and pipping Neeraj to the title. The organisers of the event called it “one of the greatest javelin competitions of all time.”\\n\\nHere are a few interesting nuggets about the 90m club:\\n\\nThe 90m mark in men’s javelin (800g) has been breached a total of 129 times in history by 26 different athletes, considering of course the one best throw in any given event. One man alone is responsible for 34 of those: Czechia legend Jan Zelezny, the world record holder and, more relevantly, Chopra’s coach. “Growing up, I admired Jan’s technique and precision and spent a lot of time watching (YouTube) videos of him,” Chopra had told World Athletics last year. One of those videos would surely have been the massive 98.48m that is currently the world record, set in May 1996 in Jena, Germany. It has stood the test of time.\\n\\nAmong the 26 athletes who have now breached the 90m barrier, Doha is a popular destination. The Suhaim bin Hamad Stadium in the Qatari capital is where five members of this club – Thomas Röhler, Anderson Peters, Jakub Vadlejch, and now Chopra and Weber – have come up with their best throws. Seven different athletes have thrown 90m+ at the venue with Rohler achieving it twice. Kuortane in Finland has also seen 8 90m+ throws achieved by 5 different athletes.\\n\\nThe other name apart from Zelezny that is unmissable in this list is Germany’s Johannes Vetter who, until recently, was throwing beyond 90m for fun and even threatened the world record, going as close as 97.76m. Indeed, it is the Germans who dominate this mini group, with 7 members over the years, the most recent being Weber on Friday. The second best is Finland – which is regarded the spiritual home of javelin – followed by two from Czech in Zelezny and Chopra’s peer Vadlejch. A total of 16 countries feature in this club and thanks to Chopra, India is now one of them.\\n\\nSince the new records have been maintained since the late 1980s, a decade wise breakdown indicates that we might be entering an golden era. While seven men broke the 90m club in the 1990s, it went down to six in the 2000s and 2010s. But halfway into the 2020s, we already have seven new members in the club. The 1990s also witnessed 40 different events where 90m was broken, thanks mainly to Zelezny — and that number is up to 21 in 2020s.\\n\\nIf Chopra, like he always has been, hits a new patch of consistent 90m+ throws in the company of Zelezny, we are in for some highly enthrallingly competitive events.',\n",

Cruise, who spoke to BFI just days ago about his global ambition, adding he always wanted to push Hollywood beyond America and make himself global while also exploring different cultures, filming styles, etc, said that he loves Indian films and would definitely give a try at filmmaking inspired by Bollywood. The actor is currently promoting The Final Reckoning. The film premiered at the 78th Cannes Film Festival and received a 5-minute-long standing ovation. In the video going viral, Cruise is seen chatting with Indian actor Avneet Kaur.\\n\\nAlso read: Mission Impossible – The Final Reckoning movie review: Tom Cruise’s last rodeo as Ethan Hunt makes a feeble appeal for a united world\\n\\n“Main aap sabse bohot pyaar karta hoon (I love you all a lot),” Cruise says with a big smile and pretty solid Hindi pronunciation, in a video that’s making the rounds online. “I love Bollywood films. It’s something that I have grown up watching—musicals from different countries. The skill it takes to do what you all do is so natural. I love it when someone suddenly breaks into a song. It’s beautiful,” he added. The Top Gun star sat for a fun conversation with Avneet, who attended the 2025 Cannes Film Festival for her film Love in Vietnam with Shantanu Maheshwari. Earlier, Avneet also shared multiple pictures with the Hollywood A-lister when she recently met him during the London premiere of The Final Reckoning. Last year, she even visited the set, fueling buzz about her role in the franchise’s last chapter, however, nothing has been confirmed so far.\\n\\nAlso read: Tom Cruise’s Mission Impossible Final Reckoning is lowest rated M:I film on Rotten Tomatoes since 2006, far behind Fallout and Ghost Protocol\\n\\nCruise recalled his 2011 trip to India for Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol promotions. The film has some shots taken in Mumbai (alongside Anil Kapoor). Kapoor played the role of Brij Nath, a media personality based in India, in the fourth instalment of the franchise. At the time, the Top Gun star also made it to the Taj Mahal. That trip, he says, left a lasting impact. “I went to the Taj Mahal, just beautiful. Just Mumbai was extraordinary,” he said, adding, “I’ll just never forget it.” Now, all these years later, he’s not only been watching Bollywood, but also lowkey dreaming of making one. “I would love to go back to India and make a film there,” he says. “That is such a unique experience and craftsmanship of the actors to be able to sing, dance, and act. It would be so much fun doing that.” Tom even threw in one of his Hindi lines from the movie: “Mujh par bharosa karo, ek aakhri baar” (Trust me, one last time), after adding, “I have so many friends there. I have met such amazing people there.”\\n\\nTom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning released in India on Saturday in multiple languages, Hindi, English, and Telugu, a day ahead of its global premiere. Directed by Christopher McQuarrie, the film will wrap up the franchise with no plans for revival in the near future. The film also stars Hayley Atwell, Simon Pegg, Esai Morales, Angela Bassett, Ving Rhames, and Henry Czerny.',\n",
       "  'I tried out Google’s Android XR Glasses and I’m convinced this is the AI assistant I have been waiting for\\n\\nThe demo lasted just a few minutes, but it left a lasting impression and made me feel the real power of having an AI assistant like Gemini being there to help you with everyday functioning.\\n\\nFor me, the most exciting part of the Google I/O keynote came right at the end — the Android XR announcements which included the return of what some of us remember as Google Glasses. So, when the chance presented itself to check out the Glasses at a demo zone, I queued up for the same without any hesitation.\\n\\nAs I was in the queue, a representative of the Android XR team took away my glasses to scan them for their power. As I reached my turn at the demo a few minutes later, they had a custom lens ready for me.\\n\\nThe Glasses, though a prototype, are comfortable to wear and not really heavy. They have an inbuilt camera, a touch-sensitive temple lined with speakers. The right lens had a small prism on which I could see the time and temperature. As you tap the temple, Gemini wakes up and is ready for your queries. You tap again to pause Gemini.\\n\\nMy first demo was with a painting on the wall as I asked the Glasses to identify the painter. Soon, I could hear a detailed explanation on the painter, with the text of what Gemini was saying showing up on the in-lens display. This took some time for me to adjust to as I use progressive lenses to help me with reading too. But in a few seconds, I could see the text clearly, though this does come in the way of what you are seeing. I think a lot of users might prefer to be guided only by voice when they use the XR Glasses full time.\\n\\nThen I walked over to another demo zone where I was staring at a very unique coffee machine. I asked Gemini how I could make an Espresso with this contraption. The Glasses immediately started telling me how to use the machine. But this is where I found the text coming on the lens a bit of an irritant — again voice would be perfect in a situation where I just needed instructions.\\n\\nFor the next demo, I asked the Android XR Glasses to summarise a page from a Lonely Planet travel guide. Again, it gave a quick summary about the Southern Alps which would have saved me a lot of reading.\\n\\nThat’s when I went off script and asked it to count the number of apples in a bowl on the table. “Six apples,” came the answer. And it took me a while to realise Gemini was right as I thought there were much more apples there. In fact, there were four pears too and the Glasses did a good job of isolating and counting the apples.\\n\\nThe demo lasted just a few minutes, but it left a lasting impression and made me feel the real power of having an AI assistant like Gemini being there to help you with everyday functioning. You can access any app on the phone, take photos, dictate replies to emails and messages. But what makes it even more powerful would be the power to remember everything the camera saw and not just what registered in your brain. Also, this could be like a rewind for your life, and you can technically go back a few days and remember where you left the locker key, or what exactly your friend told you during an argument. The possibilities are endless.\\n\\nAnd remember, what I used was a prototype, and the final product is sure to be much better. I am waiting to buy one, provided it can get my prescription glasses right.\\n\\nNandagopal Rajan writes on technology, gadgets and everything related.

The injury means the 30-year-old, who was set to feature for England Lions in their match against India A in first week of June with an eye on a Test call-up, may have to wait for his turn.\\n\\nArcher sustained the injury while playing for the Rajasthan Royals against the Kolkata Knight Riders on May 4 in the 2025 IPL. England said he will “reassessed over the next fortnight to determine when he may return to action”. The 30-year-old had been left out of the squad for the following three-match T20 series in order to play for England Lions against India A.\\n\\nArcher, who last featured in a Test back in February 2021, was supposed to ease into the England squad on the back of the A series. With his return slightly delayed, it remains to be seen if England include him straightaway for the first Test against India starting on June 20 at Leeds. Archer has been hampered with back and elbow injuries since he last played Test cricket for England in February 2021.\\n\\nReports emerging from England indicate that in case Archer isn’t able to feature in any of the Lions fixtures against India A, then he could turn up for Sussex in County Championship to test himself ahead of the five-match Test series.\\n\\nFor the five-match Test series which kick-starts a new World Test Championship (WTC) cycle, England are already without their other pacer Mark Wood. With Archer also injury-prone, England will not have his services for the entire duration of the series and have already given a maiden call-up to 27-year-old seamer Sam Cook. With 321 first-class scalps to his name at an incredible average of 19.85, England believe his experience could come handy and bolster an attack that is ravaged by injuries.\\n\\nOther than Cook, with Chris Woakes also not regaining full fitness because of an injury he suffered during the SA20, England’s pace bowling options only include Gus Atkinson, Matthew Pots and Josh Tongue. Beyond them, captain Ben Stokes is the other seam bowling option, and he is returning to international cricket after a long cap, having injured his hamstring mid-December.\\n\\nEngland are scheduled to play a one-off Test against Zimbabwe beginning Thursday at Nottingham.',\n",
       "  'Conflicts in Africa | Why Sudan remains trapped in prolonged civil war\\n\\nSudan has remained embroiled in a devastating civil war for more than two years, causing an estimated 62,000 deaths and the displacement of approximately 14 million people. But what are the root causes of the war and why has a political resolution remained elusive?\\n\\n— Samir Bhattacharya\\n\\n(From civil wars and insurgencies to ethnic tensions and resource-based disputes, Africa has long been a continent marked by conflicts, resulting in widespread instability and humanitarian crises. The region is also becoming a battleground for global power struggle. In the Conflicts in Africa series, our experts explore the root causes of major African conflicts and their impact on India’s interests. They will also examine prospects for a peaceful future in the continent.)\\n\\nAfter weeks of fierce fighting, Sudan’s army has announced that it has pushed the rival paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) out of the capital Khartoum. But the Northeast African nation continues to reel from the prolonged conflict that began in April 2023.\\n\\nSince its outbreak, the ongoing civil war in Sudan has evolved into what is widely regarded as the most severe displacement crisis in modern history. The escalating conflict between two rival military factions — the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary RSF, under the command of General Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo — has thus far resulted in an estimated 62,000 deaths and the displacement of approximately 14 million individuals, with no clear end in sight.\\n\\nBut how has the rivalry between the SAF and RSF shaped the course of the civil war? What are the possible pathways to peace in the war-torn African nation?\\n\\nSudan’s “fight to the death”\\n\\nThe origins of the current crisis in Sudan can be traced back to 2019, following the ousting of long-time dictator Omar al-Bashir. His rule lasted from 1989 to 2019 and was characterised by authoritarianism, widespread corruption, human rights violations, and economic mismanagement.\\n\\nAs part of his strategy for “coup-proofing” his regime, Bashir established powerful parallel security forces. Among these was an Arab militia known as the “Janjaweed”, which primarily recruited Baggara (cattle herders) Arabs from the Darfur and Kordofan regions. This militia, which later evolved into the RSF, also played a significant role in the Darfur conflict between 2003 and 2005, leading to the genocide of approximately 200,000 indigenous black African Muslims.\\n\\nIronically, General Burhan’s regular military forces and the RSF cooperated in the coup to oust Omar al-Bashir in 2019. After Bashir’s removal, a fragile agreement was forged between civilians and the military to establish a transitional government with a civilian prime minister. However, the fragile coalition between the civilian and military factions quickly disintegrated. In October 2021, General Burhan orchestrated another coup, this time dissolving the transitional government and detaining civilian leaders, including Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok.\\n\\nFollowing a prolonged political deadlock after the coup, a framework agreement was eventually signed. A key provision of this transition agreement was the planned merger between the national army and the RSF. The recent violence is a direct consequence of disagreements regarding the integration of RSF paramilitaries into the Sudanese Army and the question of who should oversee\\n\\nthe process.\\n\\nSince then, General Burhan, leader of the Sovereignty Council, has effectively served as Sudan’s de facto president. As General Dagalo continues challenging him for power, it has become a “fight to the death”, an existential tussle for power and control over resources between two leaders. This deadly contest can also be seen as part of a broader historical pattern.\\n\\nSudan’s current conflict is not without historical precedent. Over the past seventy years, the country has experienced twenty attempted coups, ranking second only to Bolivia in the frequency of such events, reflecting a deeply entrenched pattern of political instability. In addition, Sudan has endured two protracted civil wars, the most recent of which culminated in 2011 with the secession of South Sudan, now recognised as Africa’s newest sovereign state.\\n\\nThe country’s tumultuous past has laid the foundation for the current crisis, creating a vicious cycle of conflict and instability. Therefore, any efforts to establish lasting peace in Sudan must be based on a comprehensive understanding of the complex and interrelated historical, political, and societal factors that continue to shape the country’s volatile environment.\\n\\nThe underlying causes of the conflict are both multifaceted and deeply entrenched. Primary factors that have contributed to the outbreak of the current crisis include the pronounced politicisation of ethnic and regional identities, persistent challenges related to democratisation and governance, and the significant influence of external actors.\\n\\nWhile most violent conflicts have occurred during the post-colonial period, the colonial era played a decisive role in laying the foundations for many of these enduring issues.\\n\\nWhen Sudan gained independence from Britain and Egypt in 1956, it inherited more than just a new flag — it also inherited deep and dangerous divisions. Under colonial administration, policies of “divide and rule” and indirect governance fostered significant regional and ethnic divisions, particularly between the predominantly Arab and Muslim North and the largely African, Christian, or animist South.\\n\\nColonial authorities promoted the perception of Arab superiority — particularly among riverine Arab groups — over populations in regions such as Darfur and southern Sudan. This preferential treatment extended to the allocation of positions within the bureaucracy and military, where Arabs were disproportionately represented. These colonial-era policies institutionalised ethnic hierarchies and sowed the seeds of the identity-based tensions that continue to destabilise Sudan today.\\n\\nIn the post-colonial period, the divisions entrenched during Sudan’s colonial era were further intensified by political marginalisation, economic disparities, and the systematic exclusion of the southern population from meaningful participation in the central government. These identity-based cleavages significantly hindered the development of a cohesive and inclusive national identity.\\n\\nOver time, the failure to address these structural inequalities and grievances contributed directly to the secession of the southern region and the eventual establishment of the Republic of South Sudan.\\n\\nThe evolution of regimes in post-colonial Sudan has been marked by mismanagement, corruption, authoritarian rule, and a pattern of neglect and confrontation. Successive governments have been marked by corruption, nepotism, exclusion, injustice, and the inequitable distribution of national resources. These systemic issues have not only worsened poverty and weakened the state but have also eroded social cohesion, thus exacerbating the conditions that fuel violent conflict.\\n\\nFor much of the past seventy years, Sudan has been under the control of autocratic leaders who promoted Arab supremacist ideologies, often at the expense of marginalised ethnic groups such as the African tribes of Darfur and the people of South Sudan. This legacy of exclusion and inequality continues to shape the country’s political landscape and contribute to its instability.\\n\\nAnother indicator of Sudan’s fragile state is its economic structure, which has long been marked by a heavy dependence on oil resources alongside widespread corruption. In 2011, the secession of South Sudan, which controlled over 75 per cent of the country’s oil reserves, inflicted a significant blow to Sudan’s economy. The loss of this vital resource deepened existing economic grievances and heightened discontent across the nation, contributing to the broader instability that continues to plague the country today.\\n\\nSudan is strategically located at the crossroads of the Red Sea, the Sahel, and the Horn of Africa. The country is endowed with vast arable land and an array of abundant natural resources, including petroleum, natural gas, gold, silver, chromite, manganese, gypsum, mica, zinc, iron, lead, uranium, copper, kaolin, cobalt, granite, nickel, tin, and aluminium. Sudan’s geographic position, coupled with its wealth of natural resources, makes it a significant area of interest for multiple countries.\\n\\nThe ongoing crisis in Sudan is heavily influenced by the involvement of multiple external actors, each driven by its own political agenda and interests. Sudan shares borders with seven countries — Chad, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, the Central African Republic, Libya, and Egypt — and holds significant geopolitical importance.\\n\\nTherefore, different countries such as Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Russia, have sought to secure friendly governments in line with their strategic objectives. In doing so, they have contributed to the crisis by backing different factions and employing a range of tactics to shape the country’s political landscape.\\n\\nSudan’s experiment with democracy has become a paradox, failing to establish good governance or bring stability to the country. At present, Sudan is grappling with severe shortages of food, water, medicine, and fuel, while more than half of the population — approximately 25.6 million people — are facing acute food insecurity, including 8.5 million of them experiencing emergency levels of deprivation.\\n\\nIn the absence of a resolution to the crisis, hundreds of thousands more individuals are likely to be forced to flee in search of refuge and basic humanitarian assistance.\\n\\nThe Sudanese Civil War is indeed a complex conflict with deep historical roots. While the situation remains dire, there are potential pathways to peace that need to be explored. However, addressing the root causes would require a fresh approach, one that involves all relevant stakeholders in meaningful negotiations and commits to long-term economic and political reforms.\\n\\nIn these negotiations, local peace priorities must take precedence over the geopolitical interests of foreign powers. Above all, the peaceful restoration of democratic governance in Sudan must be prioritised within the national and regional security frameworks.\\n\\nPost Read Questions\\n\\nSince its outbreak in April 2023, the ongoing civil war in Sudan has evolved into what is widely regarded as the most severe displacement crisis in modern history. Evaluate.\\n\\nSudan’s current conflict is not without historical precedent.

       "  'Three Bangladeshi women, including one posing as transgender, held in Delhi\\n\\nTwo of the accused were found using smartphones with the banned IMO app to communicate with their families in Bangladesh, police said\\n\\nThree Bangladeshi women residing illegally in Delhi, including one who posed as a transgender, have been apprehended from North West Delhi’s Mahendra Park, police said on Saturday.\\n\\nThe accused have been identified as Aleena (22), Tangina Rahaman alias Deepa (22), and Suhan Khan (30), said DCP (North West) Bhisham Singh. Two of the accused were found using smartphones with the banned IMO app to communicate with their families in Bangladesh, police said.\\n\\n“In May, a team of the Foreigners Cell began analysing social media accounts of suspected individuals. During this exercise, it was observed that a suspected illegal Bangladeshi transgender was residing at Mahendra Park. She was allegedly disguising herself as a woman from West Bengal and had taken to selling momos from a street cart to avoid suspicion,” he added.\\n\\nThe police identified the woman as Deepa, who was apprehended on Thursday after she posted a video reel on social media showing an ice cream cart and inadvertently revealed surrounding buildings in a lane. The officers scanned about 50 lanes to locate the area and then identified the house shown in the reel, said Singh.\\n\\n“During questioning, she revealed that she had been in a relationship with a man she met on Facebook. After a period of online communication, she illegally crossed the Bangladesh border and entered India. Her boyfriend received her in West Bengal and subsequently brought her to Delhi, where they started living together in a rented accommodation. Neighbours knew her as Deepa and believed her to be a native of West Bengal,” he added.\\n\\nShe allegedly told the police that she had crossed over to India illegally through Hili and Benapole border areas in West Bengal.\\n\\nFollowing her questioning, two more Bangladeshi women were detained, said police. Both initially claimed to be Indian citizens married to local men, but their phones and personal items revealed otherwise, said police.\\n\\nAll three have been handed over to the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) at RK Puram for deportation proceedings, said officers.',\n",
       "  'Mission Impossible – The Final Reckoning movie review: Tom Cruise’s last rodeo as Ethan Hunt makes a feeble appeal for a united world\\n\\nMission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning movie review: The film is an ode to Tom Cruise. In its numerous flashbacks to the previous M:I films, it underlines the times Ethan Hunt saved the world, and honours the people he loved and lost.\\n\\nDid someone switch a few vowels, maybe? In a film where so many are talking so much, that won’t be entirely, well, impossible. For, this eighth and last (or so they say) film in the M:I franchise could as easily have been called Mission: Impassable, given its tortuous course.\\n\\nThe Final Reckoning, of course, is the second half of what began as Part I in 2023. Five hours and 31 minutes later (making the two Final Reckonings the longest films in the franchise), you are still trying to care enough about the villain to hate it.\\n\\nAnd given that you have arguably the biggest movie star in the world on the other side, that should not be so hard. Tom Cruise is still out there giving it his all – and yes, doing his own stunts – kicking butt, dodging bullets, diving off submarines, dangling now not from one but two planes, almost dying not once but twice.\\n\\nAlso read – Mission Impossible Fallout review: The best Mission Impossible movie yet\\n\\nWriter-director Christopher McQuarrie spares no expense, taking the story from London underground to the Arctic Circle, Virginia’s Emergency Command Centre to South Africa’s Doomsday Vault, and some other stops in the middle. But, it must be asked, why exactly. The chase remains – like in Part I – of an Artificial Intelligence software gone rogue and dubbed the Entity, which is apparently trying to destroy the world (Ethan Hunt, that is Cruise, must take the President’s word for it, which is surely not a good starting point in a world where tech lies in bed with power).\\n\\nSurely, a simpler investment would be someone to write a counter code. But that would not leave Ethan much to do, would it? Particularly as the brains in that department are his two loyal sidekicks returning for the job, Luther (Rhames) and Benji (Pegg). Also returning is Grace (Atwell), whose pickpocketing skills that we saw in Part I are the best resource in a world running out of time.\\n\\nSo this time, Ethan’s mission is retrieving some sort of a device from a Russian submarine that crashed somewhere in the ocean bed sometime in 2012. When a poison pill developed by Luther is plugged into it, Entity would be poof!\\n\\nIf only someone would say poof! If it’s not complicated enough that Entity has brought the world to the brink of a nuclear disaster (a lot of nuclear talk here), lots of men and – hats off – women hold whispered, urgent conversations throughout The Final Reckoning about “counter-acoustic devices”, “primordial digital ooze”, “hyperbaric decompression chambers”, underwater pressure and what it does to a human body… etc etc. And this is even before Cruise gets to the Russian submarine.\\n\\nThe action inside that submarine, precariously balanced and one tip away from crashing, with water filling up and missiles floating about, dead bodies jumping up, and Ethan figuring out its many panels and chambers, is one of the most breathtaking sequences of The Final Reckoning. At the very least, it is something original in a franchise that seems to have run out of original ideas on what\\n\\nto put Ethan through – though Cruise still makes running that fiercely and hanging mid-air that fearlessly look easy. The M:I score barely makes an appearance, and those famous masks get barely a peeling.\\n\\nAbove all, The Final Reckoning is an ode to that Cruise, in its numerous flashbacks to the previous M:I films, underlining the times he saved the world, and just how jaw-droppingly, the sacrifices he made, the people he loved and lost.\\n\\nRead more – Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One movie review: Tom Cruise delivers bang for the buck thrills\\n\\nAnd if McQuarrie, who with five films got the most out of this franchise after his lead actor, is not showing Cruise in action, he has people gushing about it. “The world would be a very different place without you, or not there at all,” is one such praise, followed by many different versions of the same. People can’t help praising Ethan even seconds away from the explosion of megatons of detonators.\\n\\nEthan is supposed to be doubting his contribution, in terms of gains versus loss, and The Final Reckoning makes a feeble appeal for a united world, not divided by nationalities, more than once. That is, till the world is brought to the brink again – and saved.\\n\\nBut hey, Cruise remains one of the best people to do that still. He just needs a better world than The Final Reckoning’s to save.\\n\\nLong time back, in M:I II, Anthony Hopkins’s character tells Ethan: “Now, it’s not Mission Difficult is it… Difficult would be a walk in the park for you.”\\n\\nSo, we’ll wait for a new mission – should Cruise choose to accept it.\\n\\nMission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning Director – Christopher McQuarrie Cast – Tom Cruise, Hayley Atwell, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Esai Morales, Pom Klementieff, Angela Bassett Rating – 3/5',\n",
       "  \"Tripura CPM says import curbs on Bangladeshi products will affect people on both sides of border\\n\\nWhile trade representatives have welcomed the central government's import restrictions, the Opposition CPM has emerged as the first voice of dissent.\\n\\nTripura’s Leader of the Opposition Jitendra Chaudhury said on Wednesday the central government’s import restrictions on Bangladeshi products would lead to losses for both India and the neighbouring country, even as he acknowledged what he said were the probable triggers for the curbs.\\n\\n“A slew of anti-India comments were coming from Bangladesh with encouragement from the Bangladeshi administration. A lot of human trafficking of Bangladeshi nationals into Tripura also came to the fore recently. I feel these restrictions might have been temporarily imposed because of all these reasons,” the CPM leader told reporters.\\n\\nHowever, Chaudhury said trade and commerce “benefit a country, subcontinent, continents, and international relations in economic, cultural, social, and political aspects”.\\n\\n“This (restriction) is a loss for us indeed”, he added. “Trade and commerce means economic transactions and expansion of scope of employment. If this is stopped, it would lead to loss not only for us, but for people on the other side of the border as well.”\\n\\nTwo days ago, the director of the industries and commerce department, Shailesh Kumar Yadav, chaired a meeting at the Integrated Check Post in Agartala to discuss the Centre’s new import restrictions.\\n\\nIn the meeting, Yadav said that some items including edible oil, fish, LPG and crushed stone would be exempt from the restrictions.\\n\\nThe meeting, also attended by officials including from the BSF and the customs and immigration departments, discussed concerns related to the Directorate General of Foreign Trade’s order restricting the import of items including garments, plastic goods, wooden furniture, fruit drinks, processed food through any land customs stations or integrated check posts in Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Tripura as well as through land customs stations at Changrabandha and Fulbari in West Bengal.\\n\\nWhile trade representatives have welcomed the restrictions and committed to complying with them, the Opposition CPM has emerged as the first voice of dissent.\\n\\nAsked when elections might be held in Bangladesh, especially given that the chief advisor’s administration has been delaying polls since the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League government’s fall last year, Chaudhury said, “I can’t comment on whether or when elections will be held in Bangladesh. But they are descendants of the 1971 Liberation War tradition. They are the torch-bearers of that tradition. So, that spirit can be hijacked for the time being… The Jamaat-e-Islami or forces who supported Pakistan as razakars (in 1971) can’t always suppress the conscience of Bangladeshi citizens forever. I can’t, however, comment on whether the elections will be held in December”.\\n\\nChaudhury, who visited Bollamukha near the international border at Belonia in South Tripura district, said many parts of the area were inundated in pre-monsoon rain, which also caused crop damage, adding that waterlogging and flooding were likely in the forthcoming monsoon as natural\\n\\nwater flow to the Indian side had been hampered by an embankment built on the Bangladesh side.\\n\\nChaudhury, who was accompanied by local MLA Dipankar Sen, Ashok Mitra and others, called for steps to be taken on a war footing to tackle the situation.\\n\\nAmid tensions over the embankment built in Bangladesh in April, months after a similar structure was seen near the international border at Devipur in Tripura’s Unakoti district, a state government team visited Belonia and border villages, and held discussions with public representatives, the district magistrate, and other officials. The visiting officials then said repair work on embankments on the Indian side damaged in last year’s devastating floods would be completed by June.\",\n",

But in a recent incident, a dog turned hero not for a person, but for his fellow four-legged friend.\\n\\nIn Milford, Connecticut, United States, a French bulldog named Yogi, who suffers from severe epilepsy, was home alone with his younger brother Reggie, a 16-month-old boxer. Their owner, Sarah McArdle Strilka, wasn’t home when Yogi suddenly had a seizure. But Reggie sprang into action.\\n\\nSurveillance footage captured Reggie’s instinctive response. Despite having only seen one seizure before, he rushed to Yogi’s side – nudging him, pacing around, and keeping him upright to prevent choking or aspiration. For nearly three hours, Reggie stayed by his brother’s side, offering support and comfort until Strilka returned. “As soon as Yogi started seizing when I wasn’t home, Reggie jumped into action,” she told Storyful. “If it wasn’t for Reggie, Yogi would not be alive today.”\\n\\nThe touching video, shared by multiple Instagram accounts including @sarahmcardlestrilka, quickly went viral.

The post-mortem report categorically stated the cause of death to be due to smothering (as part of the attempted sexual assault); the last seen with theory, the witnesses in the case — none of whom turned hostile… We also submitted before the court the aspect that the accused is the topmost authority being the principal of the school while the victim was a defenceless six-year-old student..”\\n\\nNair added, “We (the state) will challenge the order on all the points. When the order is available, we will file an appeal against it.”\\n\\nThe court, while handing out 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment in the case, also slapped a fine of Rs 2.10 lakh on the accused, to be paid to the victim’s father. Defence lawyer AR Chauhan told the court that the forensic evidence put forth by the prosecution were “inconclusive”. Chauhan said, “The sections of POCSO were added by the police later in the case. The forensic reports did not offer any conclusive evidence and was in favour of the accused, which is why the court has convicted for an act of negligence that caused death, not amounting to murder. The sentence is the maximum punishment under the section.”\\n\\n31 prosecution witnesses examined\\n\\nA total of 31 prosecution witnesses were examined in the case, including child witnesses as well as teachers and other eyewitnesses in the case, who had last seen the victim with the accused. The 1700-page chargesheet, filed by the Dahod Police within 12 days of the crime, had emphasised on the forensic evidence collected in the case, which was also the first to include ‘Touch DNA’ or the rare Epithelial Cell DNA profiling as well as Forensic Vehicle analysis to tighten the case against the accused.\\n\\nThe police had relied heavily on Epithelial Cell DNA testing to extract evidence from the accused’s car, in which the alleged crime occurred although the accused allegedly attempted to destroy evidence by sending his vehicle for a wash to Godhra. A state government release in October 2024 had also emphasised on the scientific technologies used in the case, including digital evidence, forensic DNA analysis, and forensic biological analysis, forensic chemistry, forensic vehicle analysis, forensic toxicology, forensic voice spectrography were used in the case investigation.\\n\\nIt was on the evening of September 19 that the victim’s family had found her body in the backyard of her primary school in the district, after launching a frantic hunt when the girl did not return from school. During the police probe, the family had informed the cops that the victim’s mother had sent the girl in the accused principal’s car on her way to school that morning. The principal was arrested on September 22 for alleged rape and murder of the victim.',\n",
       "  'Vaibhav Suryavanshi’s emergence provides lone bright spark in Rajasthan Royals’ underwhelming season\\n\\nOver dependent on their top-order, Rajasthan pay the price for leaving too many holes at the end of the auction\\n\\nRajasthan Royals lost any interest in the race for the 2025 Indian Premier League (IPL) playoffs a long time ago – with their propensity to mess up chases from winning positions largely to blame – but they can pat themselves on the back for giving an opportunity to a player who would be considered too young for elite competition by every metric, except talent.\\n\\nVaibhav Suryavanshi had made his name in under-19 cricket when he smashed a whirlwind century against the Australians, which would have prompted Royals to take a punt on him. But even they wouldn’t have predicted that the 14-year-old would end up being the brightest spot in their forgettable campaign.\\n\\nIt took an injury to regular captain Sanju Samson for Suryavanshi to get picked, but once he got the opportunity against Lucknow Super Giants, he didn’t waste any time and smashed Shardul Thakur over extra cover for six off the first ball he faced in the IPL.\\n\\nThat 20-ball 34 was just the appetizer as he properly announced his arrival in only his third game, smashing 101 off 38 balls against Gujarat Titans, making a mockery of a target of 210. It was the second-fastest century in IPL history, the fastest by an Indian.\\n\\nThat knock would be talked about for a long time, but Suryavanshi’s innings during the successful chase against Chennai Super Kings in Delhi on Tuesday showed a dash of maturity in his game, indicating that he can play according to various situations, and is not just a batsman of the slam-bang variety.\\n\\nWhile his earlier knocks were exercises in breathtaking shot-making and bravado, Tuesday’s effort was a relatively tempered one. Even in his century against GT, there were a fair few leading edges and top edges that eluded the fielders, and even went to the boundary, especially in the early part of his innings. Suryavanshi was more in control against CSK, even though 57 in 33 balls with four fours and as many sixes meant that the bowlers were always under pressure.\\n\\nWhen opening partner Yashasvi Jaiswal was taking the bowlers on, the teenager was content to watch from the non-striker’s end. In fact, he contributed just a single in a stand of 37 off 22 balls. Suryavanshi even showed a semblance of defence, getting behind the line of good-length balls.\\n\\nA tentative poke went for a boundary through where a slip would have been, but in Samson’s company Suryavanshi began to open his shoulders and display his fast eye and quick hands through the ball.\\n\\nMost hitters tend to favour the onside, but the boy from Bihar showed he is more than that, managing to cream pacers through and over covers. After the powerplay, he didn’t ignore the value of singles, rotating strike by finding gaps in the field. It was complete contrast to his previous innings against Punjab Kings his entire score of 40 came only in boundaries and sixes (4×4, 4×6). Afghan left-arm wrist-spinner Noor Ahmed has been CSK’s best bowler in the tournament, but Suryavanshi took him to the cleaners in the eighth over. When Noor pitched short, he was deposited in the stands over deep square-leg, and when he erred on the fuller side, he was driven forcefully through the covers for back-to-back boundaries. A little later, another short ball from Noor also met with the\\n\\nmaximum punishment.\\n\\nEven the experienced Ravindra Jadeja wasn’t spared as a long hop that provided width was smashed for a straight six and a pitched-up delivery was hit over the long-on boundary.\\n\\nAltogether 40 of Suryavanshi’s runs came in boundaries, but the other 17 showed he is developing the composure needed to develop other facets of his game. He picked his moments and the deliveries to go for the big shots, and it was a surprise when he perished to an ugly and needless hoick off Ravichandran Ashwin with the asking rate firmly under control, especially as RR had lost Samson in the same over. The error didn’t prove costly in the context of the match, and the youngster should take it as another lesson in his development.\\n\\nNotwithstanding the promise shown by Suryavanshi, the franchise won’t look back at the 2025 season fondly, especially with the immediate previous national head coach in their dugout. Losing close games repeatedly could result in some mental scarring, especially as all of them were winnable games. Royals only managed two victories batting second, and Suryavanshi had a key role in both of them.\\n\\nThey were heavily dependent on their top order and Samson’s untimely injury dented their prospects further. Their middle order didn’t perform with any consistency. Riyan Parag was mercurial but even when he did score runs, it didn’t result in wins for the team. Shimron Hetmyer was a big letdown, not able to finish off chases or give the required impetus at the end of an innings. He often resembled a late-order slogger just throwing his bat in the hope of making an effective connection.\\n\\nDhruv Jurel was an unsung hero in some respects with the bat, but often had too much to do in too short a time to have the desired impact. The loss of Nitish Rana midway through the season was deeply felt as could be expected to take down the opposition spinners.\\n\\nOn the bowling side, Sri Lankan spinner Wanindu Hasaranga didn’t get the number of wickets hoped for, and the injuries to pace spearhead Jofra Archer – even though he was highly inconsistent – and Sandeep Sharma left them with few options. The likes of Tushar Deshpande, Akash Madhwal, Yudhvir Singh, Fazalfaq Farooqi and Kumar Kartikeya could be expected to have a decent game or two, but couldn’t be relied upon to lead a pace attack in the IPL.',\n",

And the world is responding, adopting AI faster than ever before…,” he said, adding that the company has released over a dozen foundation models since the last edition of the conference.\\n\\nAs expected, Google’s annual conference this time is focused on AI, with the search and advertising giant showcasing a lot of new products and updates. “There’s a hard trade-off between price and performance. Yet, we’ll be able to deliver the best models at the most effective price point… We are in a new phase of AI product shift,” Pichai said in his opening keynote.\\n\\nSir Demis Hassabis, Nobel Prize winner for Chemistry as well as CEO and co-founder of Google DeepMind, announced an updated version of Gemini 2.5 Flash. Highlighting DeepMind’s vision for the future, he said AI has to be useful in everyday life by being intelligent and understanding the context you are in and being able to plan and take action on your behalf. “This is our ultimate vision for Gemini… to transform it into a universal AI system, an AI that is personal, proactive and powerful, and one of our key milestones on the road to AGI.”\\n\\nOne highlight is Google Beam, an AI-first video communication platform that has evolved from Project Starline, which Pichai said brings the world closer to having a “natural free-flowing conversation across languages”. Beam instantly translates spoken languages in “real-time, preserving the quality, nuance, and personality in their voices”.’\\n\\nGoogle also showcased VEO 3, its updated video generation platform with native audio generation capabilities too, and Imagen 4 for upscaled image generation. Taking its creative capabilities to a new level is Flow, an AI filmmaking tool custom-designed for the latest Veo and Imagen with Gemini. “Flow can help storytellers explore their ideas without bounds and create cinematic clips and scenes for their stories,” with the ability to use camera controls, a scene builder and asset management.\\n\\nThere are significant changes in Google Search also, with end-to-end AI Mode in Search launching in the US this week with the ability to ingest long prompts directly into search. “AI mode is where we will bring our first frontier capabilities into search,” Pichai said. There is also shopping in AI Mode and agentic checkout and a virtual try-on tool working directly on the user’s photos.\\n\\n“Under the hood, AI Mode uses our query fan-out technique, breaking down your question into subtopics and issuing a multitude of queries simultaneously on your behalf. This enables Search to dive deeper into the web than a traditional search on Google, helping you discover even more of what the web has to offer and find incredible, hyper-relevant content that matches your question,” explained Liz Reid, VP, head of Google Search, calling AI mode a glimpse of what is to come. “You can bring your hardest questions right to the search box.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, Hema Budaraju, vice president, product management, search, said AI Overviews in Google Search is now available in 40 new languages, including Urdu. “With this expansion, AI Overviews are now available in more than 200 countries.’ Pichai said AI overviews are driving 10%\\n\\ngrowth in search with over 1.5 billion users now.\\n\\nIn what was almost a footnote, Google announced Android XR, a new platform made for the Gemini era and one that will usher in new hardware like headsets. Samsung’s Project Moohan will be the first Android XR project and available for purchase later this year. Google Glasses with Android XR also made a debut at the keynote, 10 years after its predecessor was announced at I/O.

The incident has led many to rethink their travel plans to the region, casting a shadow over what was once a thriving tourist destination.\\n\\nAmid this uncertainty, entrepreneur Anupam Mittal, founder of Shaadi.com, decided to send a message of resilience. In a post on X, Mittal shared a picture of his flight tickets to Kashmir saying, “What Kashmir really needs is tourists to come back so I booked my ticket! If we vanish, they win.

Acknowledging India’s strong response to Pakistan following the attack, he urged people not to overlook the local community in Kashmir, people who had only recently begun to reap the benefits of peace and booming tourism.\\n\\n“The same Kashmir that was finally beginning to thrive – where tea sellers went from Rs 5,000 a month to Rs 5,000 a day… will now face cancelled trips, shuttered hotels, and another wave of fear and uncertainty,” he wrote.\\n\\nWith conviction, Mittal revealed he had booked tickets for himself and his family, choosing to support Kashmir not just in spirit but through action. He urged others to do the same – to travel mindfully, help sustain local businesses, and show solidarity with the people of Kashmir.\\n\\n“Because if we let Kashmir’s economy crumble, if we let fear win, then those who lost their lives in Pahalgam will have died in vain,” he said in the LinkedIn post.\\n\\n“We stood behind our Army. Now let’s stand beside our people,” he wrote.\\n\\nSocial media users were quick to react to Mittal’s post. A user commented, “This is more than a post—it’s a call to action wrapped in empathy and courage. While national security matters deeply, so does standing with the everyday people whose lives are disrupted the most. Thank you for reminding us that true patriotism also means supporting those quietly rebuilding hope. Booking a ticket may seem small, but it sends a loud, clear message: we choose solidarity over silence.”\\n\\nAnother user wrote, “This is the kind of leaders we want in our country who knows the real stuff, who shows up and leads from the front – kudos to you.”\\n\\nBut not many people supported what Mittal had to say. One user wrote, “Sorry but due to security Kashmir is on my permanent no travel list. Not just from news but from close people visiting it. Most\\n\\nof them got involved in one or other form of resistance like being thrown stones at their vehicles or local shops implying Kashmir is other country.

A jawan from the District Reserve Guard (DRG) was also killed in the faceoff.\\n\\nThe encounter is the latest in a series of anti-Naxal operations undertaken by security forces in Chhattisgarh, and comes against the backdrop of a deadline Home Minister Amit Shah has set to eradicate Left Wing Extremism from the country – March 31, 2026.\\n\\nWith Tuesday’s encounter, the number of Maoists killed in Chhattisgarh this year has touched 200, including 183 in the Bastar region. Last year, 219 Maoists were killed, including 217 in Bastar.\\n\\n“Based on intelligence inputs regarding the presence of CPI Maoist general secretary Basavaraju and other senior cadres of the Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC) and People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA), a joint DRG team of Chhattisgarh police from Narayanpur, Dantewada, Bijapur and Kondagaon launched this decisive operation in the jungles of Abhujmad along the border region of Narayanpur, Bijapur, and Dantewada on Monday,” said Inspector General of Police for Bastar Range, Sundarraj P.\\n\\nProud of our forces for this remarkable success. Our Government is committed to eliminating the menace of Maoism and ensuring a life of peace and progress for our people. https://t.co/XlPku5dtnZ\\n\\n— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) May 21, 2025\\n\\n“During the search operation on Wednesday forenoon, Maoists opened indiscriminate fire on security forces. Security forces fought back bravely and tactfully against the illegal and banned CPI Maoist outfit,” said Bijapur Superintendent of police Jitendra Yadav.\\n\\n“Several automatic weapons like AK-47, self-loading rifle (SLR), INSAS, Carbine and other arms and ammunitions were recovered,” said Superintendent of Police, Dantewada district, Gaurav Rai.\\n\\nNarayanpur Superintendent of Police, Prabhat Kumar, said that “a preliminary inspection of the encounter spot reveals that several other senior-level Maoist cadres have either been killed or seriously injured in this operation.”\\n\\nAbujhmad is an unsurveyed land larger than the state of Goa. While a large part is in Narayanpur, it also extends to Bijapur, Dantewada, Kanker and Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli district. Talking about the challenges faced during the operation, Additional Director General (Naxal operations) Vivekanand Sinha told The Indian Express, “Abujhmad has been the stronghold of Maoists, and a major challenge for us was covering a large area where there is no security presence. Even the nearest security camp is around 25 to 30 kilometres away. Conducting the massive operation in the hilly and undulating terrain of Maad amid the scorching heat was challenging.”\\n\\nChhattisgarh Chief Minister Vishnu Deo Sai said that “the operations are mainly carried out by DRG”. “From the beginning, we have been appealing to them (Maoists) to surrender… there is no need to keep repeating it.”\\n\\nTuesday’s encounter comes less than a month after security forces undertook a major anti-Naxal operation codenamed Black Forest in and around Kareguttalu hills on the Chhattisgarh-Telangana border. Although the encounter was called off after 21 days, top officials said that key Maoist leadership and the dreaded Battalion 1 of their armed wing, the People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army, took a heavy hit.\\n\\nThat operation began on April 21, after security forces and multiple agencies received inputs that top Maoist leaders and commanders, including Hidma Madvi, were spotted on the Karregutta hills. A total of 31 Maoists were killed in the encounter.\\n\\nThe Home Minister shared on X that “after completion of Operation Black Forest, 54 Naxalites have been arrested and 84 Naxalites have surrendered in Chhattisgarh, Telangana, and Maharashtra.”\\n\\nReferring to Shah’s post, Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote, “Our government is committed to eliminating the menace of Maoism and ensuring a life of peace and progress for our people.”',\n",
       "  'Govt school enrolment drops in 23 states; MoE expresses concern, asks states to probe cause\\n\\nOfficials point to removal of ghost entries, move back to private schools after Covid\\n\\nA steep drop in government school enrolment at the primary and upper-primary levels across 23 States and UTs in 2024-25 has evoked concern within the Union government, prompting the Ministry of Education (MoE) to ask for probes and remedial action plans from the states concerned.\\n\\nMinutes of meetings held by the MoE with 33 States and UTs in April to discuss performance, plan and budget under the PM-POSHAN scheme show that student enrolment dipped in 23 states, of which at least eight witnessed declines exceeding 100,000: led by Uttar Pradesh (21.83 lakh), Bihar (6.14 lakh), Rajasthan (5.63 lakh) and West Bengal (4.01 lakh).\\n\\nPM-POSHAN — Pradhan Mantri Poshan Shakti Nirman, formerly the midday-meal scheme — covers students up to Class 8 in government and government-aided schools. Launched three decades ago, the scheme is a flagship nutritional support programme for children in pre-primary to Class 8 in government and government-aided schools.\\n\\nIts cost is shared by the Centre and States on a 60:40 basis, with the Centre supplying foodgrains. Besides addressing child nutrition, a cooked meal in school is known to boost attendance, learning outcomes and attention spans.\\n\\nCompared to 2023-24, Karnataka saw its enrolment fall by around 2 lakh; Assam by 1.68 lakh, Tamil Nadu by 1.65 lakh and Delhi by 1.05 lakh (see chart).\\n\\nThe School Education Secretary at the MoE expressed “deep concern” over the trend and advised States to identify the reasons and submit reports by June 30, The Sunday Express has learned.\\n\\nThe drop first came to light late last year in the UDISE+ report for 2023-24, which pointed to a sharp fall of around 1.5 crore in overall school enrolment (government and private) compared to the 2018-19 to 2021-22 average. PM-POSHAN minutes show the trend continuing into 2024-25, triggering fresh concern in the government.\\n\\nMoE officials, who did not wish to be named, pointed to two possible causes. The first is a change in data-collection methodology—from school-wise reporting (just total numbers) to student-wise reporting (name, address, parents’ names and Aadhaar details). This ongoing “data cleansing” may have removed “ghost” entries, they said.\\n\\nSecond, officials noted that several States have suggested enrolment may be moving from government to private schools in the post-Covid years, reversing pandemic-era trends.\\n\\nAlongside enrolment declines, the PM-POSHAN meetings flagged low scheme coverage. In Delhi, the number of students availing midday meals fell by 97,000 in 2024-25 versus 2023-24, with only 60 percent of Balvatika (pre-primary), 69 percent of primary and 62 percent of upper-primary students covered—below the national average. The MoE has asked Delhi to “strive” to improve these figures.\\n\\nIn Uttar Pradesh, meal coverage dropped by 5.41 lakh students, by 3.27 lakh in Rajasthan and 8.04 lakh in West Bengal. Some States reported students bringing their own tiffin; all have been asked to check and ensure meal quality, officials added.',\n",
       "  'Lin Laishram calls herself ‘not the ideal Manipuri bride’ on wedding day with Randeep Hooda: ‘I couldn’t do it’; expert on embracing imperfection\\n\\n\"He was not looking at me at all because he thought that if he looks at me, he would laugh,\" said Lin Laishram\\n\\nIn a recent interview, actor Lin Laishram recalled grinning ear to ear on her Meitei wedding day with actor Randeep Hooda in November 2023. While the Manipuri wedding, which drew significant attention for their traditional attire and rituals, saw Lin and Randeep looking their absolute best, Lin called herself “not the ideal Manipuri bride” in the way she conducted herself.\\n\\n“Manipuri brides are supposed to be not smiling at all. They are not supposed to look here and there and move a lot. But I couldn’t do it. Usually, I am a still, very calm person. But that day, I don’t know what happened. I was moving so much, looking here and there, and I was looking at Randeep. And I was laughing. Randeep was sitting straight, and I was laughing, looking at him,” Lin told Hauterrfly.\\n\\nHer father even sent a person who asked her to stop smiling. “So, my father sent a person in the mandap to tell me not to laugh. ‘You look so excited to get married. ‘ I was not smiling because I was happy or excited, but I was smiling at Randeep because he was looking so proper. He was not looking at me at all because he thought that if he looked at me, he would laugh. So, I was not the ideal Manipuri bride,” added Lin, 39.\\n\\nShe also expressed that while walking towards the mandap, she “felt very nervous”. “There were 10,000 million butterflies in my stomach. I didn’t know how I was looking because I wasn’t shown the mirror. He (Randeep) said, I was looking like a goddess or something. When I reached the mandap, when I saw Randeep, very nicely sitting and following all the rituals, I felt very calm. I felt good looking at him.”\\n\\nThis sentiment reflects a deeper emotional space where personal expectations and cultural traditions intersect. According to Dr Chandni Tugnait, psychotherapist, director, Gateway of Healing, most brides (and even grooms) can resonate with such sentiments because weddings tend to be such a mammoth and once-in-a-lifetime experience.\\n\\nDeconstruct the cultural script: Instead of adhering to an idealised version of what your marriage day should look like, challenge and deconstruct the cultural expectations. “Recognise that your personal experience is just as valid, even if it doesn’t fit traditional molds,” said Dr Tugnait.\\n\\nCreate space for imperfection: Rather than striving for perfection, acknowledge the beauty in imperfection. Understand that feelings that you didn’t ‘do justice’ to your marriage day are temporary. Each and every moment is etched in life and in the memories of people who have joined in your celebrations. “So, no matter how imperfect you perceive them to be, it’s a beautiful memory that you have lived,” said Dr Tugnait.\\n\\nReframe vulnerability as strength: When you feel inadequate or disconnected from the “ideal,” it’s easy to view vulnerability as a weakness. However, embracing vulnerability, especially when shared with a supportive partner, builds a more resilient and authentic connection, said Dr Tugnait.',\n",
       "  \"Grandmaster Shyamsundar Mohanraj is on a quiet quest to produce more Indian GMs\\n\\nShyamsundar Mohanraj, who runs Chess Thulir in Chennai, is the coach of Srihari LR, who became India's 86th grandmaster last week.\\n\\n“I was super desperate to start producing grandmasters for the country,” declares GM Shyamsundar Mohanraj in a soft, yet determined, voice right after guiding Srihari LR on his quest to become a grandmaster. Last week, the Chennai-based Srihari became India’s 86th grandmaster, separated from India’s 85th by a gap of just over a year.\\n\\n“It’s been a year since India has had a GM. In India we have too many talented players so it’s a pity that we have not had a GM for so long. There are so many guys who are within touching distance of the title,” he laments.\\n\\nThe grandmaster title is the one of the hardest-earned ones in the sport of 64 squares. It’s a recognition of talent and aptitude but has to be earned by earning three norms at three different tournaments and crossing a rating threshold of 2500.\\n\\nSrihari’s 10-month-long struggle to get the final grandmaster norm reminded Shyamsundar of his own long wait to get past the finish line. The story goes that back in 2012, he had ticked off all three norms, but his coronation as a grandmaster was held up because he was just 0.2 points away from the 2500 rating.\\n\\n“I know the pain of the players who struggle so hard to become grandmaster. I was 2499.8 at some point and needed just 0.2 points. It took me six months to get that 0.2 rating. There were times when I was going to play in a tournament and had I withdrawn from that, I would have become a GM because the ratings would have been rounded off to 2500 in the next published rating list. But that’s not how I wanted to become a grandmaster. Becoming a grandmaster is just one of the things in chess. I knew I would become a GM anyway. But my goal was not just to become a GM. I wanted to become a GM in a proper way,” Shyamsundar tells The Indian Express.\\n\\nHe has brought this never-settle quality in his coaching as well and is hoping to influence his wards. When Srihari became a GM last week, in his post on Instagram wishing the teenager, Shyamsundar reminded him that now the time had come to focus on the next goal. As he explains, these days becoming a grandmaster comes with certain perks and financial opportunities that could sidetrack you and make you ease up on the hunger to forge ahead.\\n\\nHe’s already mapped out the changes he wants Srihari to bring in his playing style: trying to make him a more universal player, rather than just being a solid player.\\n\\n“Being solid is good, but it’s not enough for anyone to get to the next level,” he says about Srihari. “I want to make him a universal player, good at dynamics and positional chess. It’s tricky, because I want him to lose his ability to grind out results. I want to fine-tune his way of playing.”\\n\\nThe other lesson Shyamsundar, who is an Asian Junior Champion and Commonwealth medalist, learnt from his own career was how to deal with the pressure that comes when you’re close to the finish line. He admits that the pressure to get the GM title took a toll on him. He had sponsors promising him to invest in him once he became a GM. But that thought of getting the title quickly weighed heavy on his mind. Eventually, when he reached there six months later than he could have, and looked back, there were no sponsors in sight. Eventually, as a GM, there was a phase where he played with no job and no sponsors backing him. Every game won in a tournament would help plot an assault on a tournament in the future. A loss would pinch the pocket.\\n\\nHaving experienced these pressures first-hand, he made the conscious decision to take a break from his academy Chess Thulir in Chennai and travel to UAE for three tournaments over a 45-day period — Sharjah and Dubai following the Al Ain event — with a merry gang of six players: two GMs (Bharat Subramaniam and Pranav V) and four IMs (Srihari, Muttaiah, Aswath S and Ilamparthi AR.) All four, he stated, were close to becoming GMs with most of them needing one or two norms. They train hard, but also spend plenty of time playing other sports and cooking in each other’s company to take the edge of their professional pursuit.\\n\\nHe has gathered a band of talented youngsters who are all on the ascendancy. Aswath S last month won the Grenke Open in Germany despite being seeded 38th after scoring 8/9 and securing his first norm. He also crossed 2500 so he needs just two norms to become GM. Muthaiah AL also has two norms, and needs just 30 rating points and a final GM norm. Ilamparthi has two norms and has crossed 2500 so he’s awaiting just one more norm. At the recent event in Al Ain, he took down grandmaster Tabatabaei M Amin, and just when it looked like he could get his final norm too, he faltered.\\n\\n“Ilamparthi was ill at the end of the tournament so he could not convert winning positions. If he had, India could have had two GMs being confirmed on the same day,” says Shyamsundar.\\n\\nSince the pandemic, the world has looked towards Chennai as the world’s fastest churning conveyor belt of grandmasters. From the much-vaunted houses of RB Ramesh, Srinath Narayanan and Vishnu Prasanna have arrived the country’s top talent causing seismic tremors in the sport. Gukesh, the youngest world champion in the history of the sport, and Leon Luke Mendonca worked with Vishnu. Ramesh shaped the world-beating sibling duo of Praggnanandhaa and Vaishali besides players like Aravindh Chithambaram and Karthikeyan Murali besides also working with Leon. Srinath moulded players like Arjun Erigaisi and Nihal Sarin.\\n\\nNow, in the form of Shyamsundar comes another grandmaster from India’s in-between generation — the group between Viswanathan Anand and the golden gen of Gukesh-Pragg-Arjun — to step up to create more grandmasters.\\n\\nAmit Kamath is Assistant Editor at The Indian Express and is based in Mumbai. ...

       "  'Opinion Nirupama Rao writes: What makes this face-off with Pak structurally different is China’s embedded role\\n\\nAs China bolsters Pakistan and the US returns to crisis diplomacy, India must recalibrate terms of engagement\\n\\nThe recent bout of hostilities between India and Pakistan has once again exposed the fragility of deterrence in South Asia. This time, however, the conflict cannot be framed solely as a bilateral flashpoint. While the triggers remain familiar — cross-border provocation and military response — the broader context has shifted significantly. The United States, returning to its well-worn role of crisis manager, has momentarily revived the India-Pakistan hyphenation that New Delhi has long worked to dismantle. More consequential, though, is the increasingly visible footprint of China in Pakistan’s military posture. The conflict may have started on the Line of Control, but it now plays out in a strategic triangle, with each vertex holding different stakes and tactics.\\n\\nIndia’s retaliatory response has delivered tactical benefits. It demonstrates a credible shift from passive restraint to active deterrence. Domestically, it bolsters political legitimacy. Internationally, it signals that India will not tolerate a return to the era of consequence-free provocation. However, such tactical assertiveness must be weighed against strategic cost. Each military exchange, especially when it invites global mediation, draws India back into a regional frame it seeks to transcend. The goal must be to win engagements without re-entering a cycle that diminishes India’s identity as a global — not merely South Asian — actor.\\n\\nThe reappearance of hyphenation in global discourse, particularly through American statements seeking to “own the ceasefire”, is a diplomatic regression. For over two decades, India has sought to decouple its international positioning from Pakistan, leveraging its economic scale, democratic governance, and global partnerships. Yet, crisis has a gravitational pull. Even momentary equivalence — intended as diplomatic symmetry — risks legitimising Pakistan’s parity narrative. India must engage diplomatically but reject frameworks that reduce its global profile to regional conflict management. The message must remain clear: This is not a clash of equals but of a rules-based state and a revisionist actor.\\n\\nThe US’s posture has been cautious but familiar. During the first Trump administration, mediation was often offered impulsively, with Kashmir at times invoked as a bargaining chip in the broader Afghan calculus. The current US administration has reverted to a traditional playbook — urging restraint, activating diplomatic channels, and engaging both sides with public neutrality. While this reflects institutional continuity, it also underscores the limits of trust in India-US relations when it comes to crisis scenarios. Despite deeper strategic ties — spanning defence, technology, and Indo-Pacific cooperation — the US’s reflex remains de-escalation over alignment. For India, this is a reminder that strategic partnerships do not always translate into narrative control. Pakistan has seized the moment to showcase US involvement as a form of recognition. By amplifying external mediation, Islamabad attempts to recast itself not as a provocateur but a co-equal party in a bilateral dispute. India must resist responding on those terms. Strategic maturity lies in letting others claim headlines while securing outcomes. India must continue deepening bilateral mechanisms with key partners like the US, where cooperation ranges beyond crisis flashpoints. That breadth is the best antidote to Pakistan’s narrow frame.\\n\\nThe signalling around the Indus Waters Treaty — raising the prospect of re-evaluating its operational commitments — is a serious escalation cue. The treaty carries immense symbolic weight. India’s statements are likely aimed at increasing pressure without intending immediate disruption. Still, it is a message with regional reverberations. Water is both a national and an\\n\\necological security issue, and changes to the Indus framework would invite international scrutiny, including from China. India must wield this instrument with caution — visible enough to signal resolve, but restrained enough to avoid irreversible fallout.\\n\\nWhat makes this confrontation structurally different is China’s embedded role. Beijing is not merely a diplomatic shield for Pakistan but a material enabler. Pakistan’s current air capabilities are heavily influenced by Chinese platforms —from the co-produced JF-17 to the advanced J-10C fighters, and from Wing Loong drones to HQ-9B air defence systems. This represents more than procurement; it is doctrinal alignment. Chinese systems allow Pakistan to reduce dependency on Western suppliers while gaining combat parity with Indian platforms like the Rafale. India must prepare for conflicts where adversaries are networked, platforms are interoperable, and escalation is layered with ambiguity.\\n\\nThe use of Chinese materiel in the present crisis, if confirmed, changes the rules of engagement. Pakistani J-10Cs, armed with PL-15 long-range missiles and shielded by Chinese air defence systems, narrow India’s traditional air superiority. In any engagement, India risks confronting Chinese-origin hardware, doctrine, and possibly real-time support. The two-front threat, long theorised, now finds real-time validation. Strategic planners must absorb this reality: Pakistan no longer acts alone, and China no longer stays outside.\\n\\nWith this evolving configuration, the risk of episodic conflict becoming the norm is real. Limited engagements followed by quick ceasefires may prevent war, but they also entrench a cycle of confrontation. This rhythm serves neither India’s strategic ambitions nor regional stability. Each flare-up diverts diplomatic bandwidth, distracts from structural reform, and reinforces old narratives. India must aim not just to deter conflict, but to shift the conflict paradigm. That requires both doctrinal innovation and narrative superiority.\\n\\nThe global response, too, remains trapped in contradiction. While much of the world acknowledges India’s strategic maturity and global responsibilities, it defaults to treating South Asian crises as bilateral flare-ups needing urgent mediation. This undermines the idea of India as a stabilising Indo-Pacific power. India’s diplomatic task is twofold: To internationalise its strategic vision while localising its disputes. That means engaging global institutions not merely as stakeholders in peace, but as validators of India’s wider role.\\n\\nUltimately, this is not a moment of collapse but one of recalibration. India is confronting a new strategic geometry: Crises are triangular, platforms are shared, and narratives are contested as much as borders. The US will remain a tempering actor, but not an arbiter of truth. China will remain a silent catalyst. Pakistan, emboldened by both, will remain a spoiler. India’s task is to respond when needed, restrain when possible, and reinforce its role as a power whose stability is not defined by others’ volatility. In conflict, as in diplomacy, maturity lies not in escalation, but in the control of the terms of engagement.\\n\\nThe writer is a former foreign secretary and ambassador',\n",
       "  \"Forget the actor, it’s Mohanlal the producer who should make a comeback; the one behind both his National Awards for Best Actor\\n\\nBefore he began frequently collaborating with Aashirvad Cinemas, Mohanlal personally bankrolled over a dozen films and most of them stand among the finest mainstream Malayalam movies.\\n\\nSeeing the recent success of Thudarum, it’s almost impossible not to wonder how the same Mohanlal — who is still capable of delivering spectacular performances, as he demonstrated in the Tharun Moorthy directorial, completely shedding his star mantle and effectively silencing his critics — kept bombarding audiences with atrocities such as Ittymaani: Made in China (2019), Kaappaan (2019), Big Brother (2020), Marakkar: Arabikadalinte Simham (2021), Aaraattu (2022), Monster (2022), Alone (2023), and the biggest bomb of all, his directorial debut Barroz (2024), one after the other over the past few years.\\n\\nAlthough he did offer decent films like Drishyam 2 (2021), Neru (2023), and Malaikottai Vaaliban (2024) during the same period, his cinematic dumpster fires far outnumbered the not-bad entries, making one wonder if his involvement in the better projects was merely accidental. In fact, it’s hard not to ask: where did the old Mohanlal go?\\n\\nNo, I’m not talking about the actor he once was; probably in his 20s, 30s or even 40s. It’s senseless to expect someone in their 60s to perform with the same agility and intensity they had at half their age. But I’m not referring to the actor in him. I’m talking about the producer instead; the Mohanlal who once threw his weight behind exceptional films, sensing the true potential of a story, a project or a director, and turning himself into the creative rock on which a film could be built. What happened to that Mohanlal, the one who could recognise and help realise great films?\\n\\nBefore he began frequently collaborating with Aashirvad Cinemas, a production house established by his driver-turned-confidante-turned-close friend Antony Perumbavoor, Mohanlal, who turns 65 on Wednesday (May 21), had personally bankrolled over a dozen and a half films. In hindsight, many of these projects not only played a key role in elevating his stature as an actor but also stand among the finest mainstream Malayalam films of their era.\\n\\nInterestingly, Mohanlal entered film production for the first time alongside fellow superstar Mammootty. Together with producer Century Kochumon, director IV Sasi and his wife, actor Seema, they co-founded Casino Films. The company made its debut by bankrolling Adiyozhukkukal (1984), written by MT Vasudevan Nair and directed by Sasi himself. A hard-hitting drama, the film earned Mammootty his first Kerala State Film Award for Best Actor. Casino Films didn’t stop there, it went on to produce three more acclaimed movies — Sasi and P Padmarajan’s Karimbinpoovinakkare (1985), and Sathyan Anthikad and Sreenivasan’s Gandhinagar 2nd Street (1986) and Nadodikkattu (1987), before the superstars bid goodbye to the company. Needless to say, all of these titles have been etched into the golden annals of Malayalam cinema and remain cherished classics to this day.\\n\\nDuring this period, Mohanlal also became involved with another production house, Cheers, which launched its journey by funding P Anil’s Adiverukal (1986). Cheers went on to produce Kamal’s widely acclaimed tragedy Unnikale Oru Kadha Parayam (1987) and the comedy-drama Orkkappurathu (1988). The company’s final production was Aryan (1988), directed by Priyadarshan, which has, over time, drawn significant criticism for its casteist and savarna-centric themes and dialogues.\\n\\nBy then, Mohanlal had not only established himself as one of the finest actors in the industry but had also achieved full-fledged superstardom. Yet, he continued to invest in films that prioritised quality above all else. And soon, he floated his own production company, Pranavam Arts International. Not only did Pranavam Arts change the trajectory of Mohanlal’s career, but it also gifted the industry a handful of culturally and aesthetically significant films that defied conventional commercial formulas.\\n\\nPranavam’s films were not just starkly different from each other in terms of story and aesthetics, but they all explored and highlighted previously unseen facets of Mohanlal’s acting abilities, making significant use of his untapped potential. More than that, every film he took on as a producer seemed to possess a soul of its own. It was also as if he chose to produce only those projects that would challenge him as a performer.\\n\\nInterestingly, four out of the eleven movies he bankrolled under the banner of Pranavam Arts — named after his son Pranav Mohanlal — were penned by the acclaimed screenwriter Lohithadas, renowned for crafting some of the most celebrated dramas in Malayalam cinema, among which was Kireedam (1989), directed by Sibi Malayil, which earned Mohanlal a National Film Award – Special Mention.\\n\\nThe Sibi-Lohithadas collaboration continued with His Highness Abdullah (1990), which marked Pranavam’s debut production. The film followed Abdullah (Mohanlal), a poor Muslim Qawwali singer in Bombay, who is hired by members of an affluent royal Hindu family in Kerala to assassinate their patriarch, Maharaja Udayavarma (Nedumudi Venu). The movie not only showcased Mohanlal’s extraordinary ability to perform playback song sequences with near-perfect lip-syncing, but it also broke away from typical mainstream narratives. Unlike many films that either glorify or victimise savarna and Brahminical cultures while portraying Muslim characters in stereotypical roles that are reduced to the binaries of good and bad, His Highness Abdullah boldly exposed the rot in elitism, exemplified by a lack of compassion even among blood relatives with each person being more consumed by a greed for dynastic wealth than the other. Featuring some of Malayalam cinema’s most iconic songs, such as “Pramadhavanam,” “Devasabhathalam,” and “Gopika Vasantham,” composed by Raveendran and sung by KJ Yesudas and others, the film emerged as a major box office success.\\n\\nThe very next year, the producer-actor returned with another project, once again teaming up with the same writer-director duo. While His Highness Abdullah revolved around an impending crime with elements of a thriller too, Bharatham (1991) was a pure musical drama, featuring an unrestrained and unmatched Mohanlal at its core. Though films like Kireedam, Thalavattam (1986), and Ninnishtam Ennishtam (1986) had showcased his emotional depth as a performer, the role of Kalloor Gopinathan in Bharatham was particularly fresh and complex even for him. Centred on the minor ego clash that erupts between two brothers — Carnatic music virtuosos Gopinathan and his elder sibling Ramanathan (Nedumudi Venu) — following an unforeseen and unfortunate incident, the film gradually evolves into a deeply layered musical family drama with a powerful emotional undercurrent. Bharatham further underlined Mohanlal’s willingness to shed his star persona, portraying a character rendered helpless by life’s cruel twists and misfortunes.\\n\\nIn Kamaladalam (1992), another musical drama crafted by the Sibi-Lohithadas duo and produced by Mohanlal, the trio pushed the actor in him into uncharted territory as he portrayed a revered classical dance teacher fighting alcoholism and the ghosts of his past. Though Mohanlal’s physical agility was already well-known, primarily through comedic and cinematic dance sequences, this film revealed a completely different dimension of the same. As Nandagopan, Mohanlal delivered a jaw-dropping performance. Once again, he excelled as both producer and actor, proving how a true thespian can use his stature not just to maintain fame but to refine his craft and continually push his artistic boundaries.\\n\\nAlthough his next production ventures, Priyadarshan’s Mithunam (1993) and Sathyan Anthikkad’s Pingami (1994), failed to succeed at the box office, they remain beloved among film lovers. It was after these that Mohanlal undertook his most ambitious and grandest project yet as a producer,\\n\\nPriyadarshan’s Kaalapani (1996). In collaboration with R Mohan’s Shogun Films, Pranavam Arts mounted this epic period drama, focusing on the lives of the inmates of the Cellular Jail (Kaalapani) in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands during the British Raj. As a producer, Mohanlal spared no effort in assembling the best possible cast — including Tabu, Prabhu, Amrish Puri, Sankaradi, Nedumudi Venu, Delhi Ganesh, Sreenivasan and Cochin Haneefa — and crew, which featured stalwarts like Ilaiyaraaja (music), Santosh Sivan (cinematography), Sabu Cyril (art direction), and ST Venky (special effects). Although the film failed to recoup its then-massive production costs, Kaalapani became a landmark in Indian cinema and continues to serve as a reference point for period dramas. The movie also earned four National Film Awards.\\n\\nIn 1998, Mohanlal once again joined forces with Lohithadas and created Kanmadam, which opened to both critical and commercial acclaim. Various aspects of the film, particularly the performances of Mohanlal and Manju Warrier, received widespread praise. That same year, Pranavam Arts mounted another massive project, Harikrishnans, which marked the much-anticipated on-screen reunion of Mohanlal and Mammootty after a decade or so. Featuring Juhi Chawla in the lead, the mystery buddy comedy was directed by Fazil and jointly produced by Mohanlal and his wife, Suchitra. The film lived up to the hype and became a blockbuster, helping Mohanlal recover from the financial setbacks caused by his earlier unsuccessful ventures to an extent. Unfortunately, Pranavam’s next project, Bhadran’s Olympian Anthony Adam (1999), failed to make an impact.\\n\\nYet, nothing could dampen Mohanlal’s spirit. He once again donned the producer’s hat for Shaji N Karun’s Vanaprastham, one of the most significant films in Malayalam’s parallel cinema movement, wherein he played a lowered caste Kathakali artiste grappling with marginalisation from all quarters. An international co-production, the film opened to universal acclaim and even earned Mohanlal and Shaji a place at the Cannes Film Festival, where Vanaprastham was selected for the Un Certain Regard section. Interestingly, the two films that earned Mohanlal his National Film Awards for Best Actor — Bharatham and Vanaprastham — were both produced by him. Likewise, two of the six Kerala State Film Awards for Best Actor that he has received were for performances in films he bankrolled — Kaalapani and Vanaprastham — further underscoring his visionary instincts as a producer.\\n\\nEven after the establishment of Aashirvad Cinemas, Mohanlal returned to production in 2010, co-producing the military action film Kandahar, directed by Major Ravi. This came shortly after he was awarded the honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Territorial Army. Although the film, also featuring Amitabh Bachchan in his Malayalam debut, failed to earn critical acclaim, Kandahar served its purpose as Mohanlal’s way of expressing gratitude for the honorary military title he had received.\\n\\nBarring Kandahar, nearly every film Mohanlal has produced remains beloved — not only by his fans but by Malayalam cinema lovers in general — largely due to their artistic depth and brilliance. It is precisely this sensibility that had seemed missing from Mohanlal in recent years, as though that part of his creative mind had either become dormant or been deliberately switched off. Now that Thudarum is enjoying widespread success, one can only hope the superstar draws upon his earlier producer instincts when choosing his future acting roles.\\n\\nAnandu Suresh is a Senior sub-editor at Indian Express Online.

       "  'Opinion Tavleen Singh writes | Urgently needed: A postmortem\\n\\nIf there had been real reportage, we would at least know, now that the fog of war has lifted, whether Pakistan’s military machine is as good as ours and if it is, we should know why.\\n\\nThe defining image of Operation Sindoor for me is that photograph of senior Pakistani military officers at the funeral of a dead jihadi. In the photograph, they stand behind a bearded jihadi who stands beside the coffin of his dead relative. The coffin is covered in the Pakistani flag and wreaths of red roses lie on it. The photograph has been viral on social media for days and the names of the senior Pakistani officers mourning the death of the Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist have been made public by our government.\\n\\nThis photograph, which I have looked at many times, left me stunned because of the utter shamelessness it depicts. Ever since the horrendous massacre in Pahalgam, there has been a collaborative campaign by Pakistan’s military and civilian rulers to convince the world that the old policy of using jihadi terrorism as a weapon of war has ended. When the Islamist Republic’s military rulers are unable to convince the world of their credentials, they usually summon English-speaking, attractive civilians from well-known political families to make the case for them.\\n\\nThis time it was Bilawal Bhutto and Hina Khar (she of the Birkin bag fame) who were tasked with denying that Pakistan has anything to do any more with jihadi terrorism. Bhutto admitted that official support for jihadist terrorism was something that happened once but in ancient history. And Madame Khar made similar claims on a British TV show, while delicately fiddling with her perfectly groomed hair and lacy white dupatta. Until Barkha Dutt asked her to state clearly if she believed groups like the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed were terrorist outfits. Instead of answering the question, she fled and where her face had been, there was a blank window for the rest of the show.\\n\\nIf there is one thing that Pakistan has revealed, albeit unintentionally, is that it continues to nurture evil, cowardly fanatics who lack the courage to fight real wars and choose instead to kill innocent people. This alone means that India won the war. The purpose of Operation Sindoor was to send Pakistan’s military rulers the message that their jihadi foot soldiers would no longer be able to wander about India, killing unarmed civilians. This message was convincingly delivered with attacks on the headquarters of Lashkar-e-Taiba in Muridke and Jaish-e-Mohammed in Bahawalpur. And similar messages were delivered to jihadist encampments in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.\\n\\nWhere India lost, as it often does, was in countering Pakistan’s narrative with a more convincing narrative of our own. So, it has been asked far too many times not just by Pakistanis, but by Western commentators, why India had not provided proof that the massacre in Pahalgam was ordered by Pakistan. This emboldened far too many Pakistanis to repeat, ad nauseum, that what happened in Pahalgam was a “false flag operation”. When you live in a country that has been ruled by military men for most of its existence, it is easy to believe that it’s possible for an Indian Prime Minister to kill his own people just to find a reason to go to war. It cannot happen in a democratic country. Period.\\n\\nProof of this is that every time the Indian state has been involved in a pogrom or causing communal violence, it has been exposed and vilified. The list is too long to repeat here, but three come immediately to mind. Hashimpura in 1987, Delhi in 1984 and Gujarat in 2002. Justice may not have been fully done, but the state has been identified as the perpetrator of violence in all three cases.\\n\\nIn a wider sense, India’s messaging has been so faulty that commentators on the other side of the border believe that Hindutva is just a Hindu version of radical Islam. As someone who has not the slightest sympathy with the Hindutva ideology or its adherents, I am a little embarrassed to have to say that the equivocation is not just false, but ludicrous. The vigilantes who wander about killing Muslims on the excuse of saving cows do not have religious sanction. That is a vital difference.\\n\\nThe question we should be asking is why India seems so often to lose control of the narrative? One big reason is that our private TV channels have been so jingoistic and hysterical in their coverage of Operation Sindoor that they have harmed not just their own credibility, but the government’s credibility as well. With a handful of exceptions, most TV reporters and anchors spent more time whipping up rabid nationalism than reporting the news. It has astounded me to see how many anchors chose to express their personal opinions on Pakistan instead of trying to report fairly on what was happening.\\n\\nIf there had been real reportage, we would at least know, now that the fog of war has lifted, whether Pakistan’s military machine is as good as ours and if it is, we should know why. These are the sort of questions that would be asked if the Indian media had not been, for one reason or another, cowed into submission. Lieutenant-General H S Panag, whose views I respect, said in a recent article that technologically, Pakistan is at near parity with India and that there is need for urgent transformation in the Armed forces. In his words, “It’s crucial that the defense Budget is doubled to 4% of the GDP”. That is a truly sobering statistic.',\n",

But like any other food, how do these flatbreads made with lentil flour affect our blood sugar levels?\\n\\nMetabolic health coach Karan Sarin tested this using a CGM. Sarin ate ural dal roasted papad paired with vegetables like onion, tomato, coriander, and chillies. After two hours of having the masala papad, he noted no blood sugar spike. “There is a flatline, which is a great outcome. This papad is extremely thin, and the carb load is pretty low as long as you don’t overdo it,” said Sarin.\\n\\n“Papad is healthy if eaten in limited quantities for most people, including diabetics. While roasted papad is better than the fried variety, it should not be consumed daily,” said Sumaiya A, clinical dietitian at Fortis Hospital, Kalyan.\\n\\nThat is because while the proteins and fibre from the flour used to make papad can be beneficial, the high sodium content or deep-frying can be harmful, she added.\\n\\nDr Manisha Arora, director, internal medicine, CK Birla Hospital, Delhi said that masala papad, by itself, may have very few carbohydrates. “While it does contain refined flour, the sugar content is not very high. However, due to refined flour, masala papad’s glycemic index (GI) is high,” said Dr Arora.\\n\\nThe critical factor to consider is the portion size. The number of servings we consume determines the amount of refined flour entering our body, which can raise blood sugar levels due to its high GI. Additionally, it is essential to note what we pair it with.\\n\\nSuppose masala papad is consumed with foods high in fibre and low in GI, such as vegetables or salads. In that case, the overall impact on blood sugar can be minimised, noted Dr Arora. “However, consuming it alone or in larger portions can lead to a mild to moderate rise in blood sugar levels—approximately 20 to 50 milligrams per deciliter—within the first 30 to 60 minutes after consumption,” stressed Dr Arora.\\n\\nAnother essential factor is whether we pair it with drinks or other high-GI foods. For instance, consuming masala papad alongside sugary fizzy drinks or alcohol—both of which are high in empty calories—can significantly spike blood sugar levels, explained Dr Arora.\\n\\nA post shared by Karan Sarin (@sweetreactions)\\n\\nAs a snack, masala papad can be a reasonable choice if eaten in moderation and paired with high-fibre toppings like onions, tomatoes, or cucumbers. “These additions increase its fibre content and lower overall glycemic impact. To manage blood sugar effectively, it is advisable to limit portions and make thoughtful choices about accompanying foods and drinks,” said Dr Arora.\\n\\nDISCLAIMER: This article is based on information from the public domain and/or the experts we spoke to.

By then, countries that were manufacturing COVID-19 vaccines had hoarded millions of doses, leaving those with no vaccine plants often with no access to the shots.\\n\\nA 2022 study published by the journal Nature revealed that more than one million lives could have been saved if COVID-19 vaccines had been shared more equitably with lower-income countries — the virus had claimed more than seven million lives across the world.\\n\\nA 2021 report published by the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response said, “The combination of poor strategic choices, unwillingness to tackle inequalities, and an uncoordinated system created a toxic cocktail which allowed the pandemic to turn into a catastrophic human crisis.”\\n\\nIn a bid to prevent loss of human life, and disruption to households and societies at large – as it happened due to the COVID-19 pandemic — during future pandemics, WHO member states got together and began to iron out a treaty. It took nearly three-and-a-half years and 13 rounds of meetings to reach the deal.\\n\\nOne of the key elements of the agreement is a “pathogen access and benefit sharing” system, which gives pharmaceutical companies access to scientific data such as pathogen samples and genomic sequences in return for more equitable sharing of drugs, vaccines and diagnostics during a pandemic, according to a report in Nature.\\n\\nThe treaty says participating manufacturers will have to allocate 10% of their production of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics to the WHO. Another 10% will then be supplied at “affordable prices”.\\n\\nAlso, member states should “promote and otherwise facilitate or incentivise” the exchange of technology and know-how to help manufacturers in developing nations make their own drugs and vaccines, the agreement says.\\n\\nCountries also need to develop national policies for putting conditions on research into drugs and vaccines that they fund — given either to universities or companies — to guarantee “timely and equitable access” to resulting drugs or diagnostics during pandemics.\\n\\nMichelle Childs, policy advocacy director at the non-profit organisation Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative in Geneva, told Nature, “Concretely, this means that when the next pandemic hits and a life-saving medicine developed thanks to taxpayer funding is unaffordable or unavailable, a government will be able to intervene for the benefit of its citizens and people in need around the world.”\\n\\nAlthough the treaty has been hailed as groundbreaking and historic, several experts have said that it has a limited scope.\\n\\nFor instance, the agreement does not give the WHO powers over individual states.\\n\\nClause 24, paragraph three states, “Nothing in the WHO Pandemic Agreement shall be interpreted as providing the WHO Secretariat, including the WHO Director-General, any authority to direct, order, alter, or otherwise prescribe the national and/or domestic laws, as appropriate, or policies of any Party.”\\n\\nThe treaty also says that the WHO does not have the power to mandate or otherwise impose any requirements such as “ban or accept travellers, impose vaccination mandates or therapeutic or diagnostic measures, or implement lockdown”.\\n\\nThis means that in a situation like the fierce competition for COVID-19 vaccines, the WHO would have no way to ensure countries adhere to the terms to which they had agreed. As a result, pharmaceutical companies may hesitate to commit resources to developing medical solutions for emerging pathogens.\\n\\nDr David Reddy, Director General of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, told The Telegraph, “Intellectual property protection and legal certainty are essential for the innovative-based pharmaceutical industry to invest in high-risk research and development and enable voluntary partnerships that we will need in the next pandemic. We hope that in subsequent negotiations Member States maintain the conditions for the private sector to continue innovating against pathogens of pandemic potential.”\\n\\nAlso, currently, there is no clarity on how the pathogen access and benefit sharing system will work.\\n\\nNotably, the treaty has been agreed upon and adopted without the US. The country withdrew from negotiations after President Donald Trump came back to the White House in January, and announced his plans of withdrawing the US from the WHO.\\n\\nGiven the dominance of the US in the drug, vaccine, and diagnostics manufacturing industries, its absence will weaken the agreement, according to experts.\\n\\nLawrence Gostin, a specialist in health law and policy at Georgetown University in Washington DC, told Nature, “There is no sugar coating it. The absence of the US leaves a gaping hole.”',\n",
       "  'UP: High Court denies nod for Jeth Mela; rules ‘will not interfere with govt decision’\\n\\nThe court was hearing a bunch of petitions challenging the order issued on April 26 this year, declining permission for holding the annual Jeth Mela at and near the Dargah of Syed Sallar Masood Ghazi\\n\\nTHE LUCKNOW bench of the Allahabad High Court on Saturday refused to interfere with the decision of the state government denying permission to hold ‘Jeth Mela’ at the Dargah of Syed Sallar Masood Ghazi in Bahraich.\\n\\nA division of Justices Attau Rahman Masoodi and Subhash Vidyarthi, said in its order that, however, “Until the delivery of the judgment, as an interim measure, we provide that routine activities at Dargah Sharif for carrying out the ritualistic practices shall remain open, for which all support for maintaining law and order as well as necessary civic amenities shall be provided by the State in co-operation with the Committee administering the management of Dargah Sharif.”\\n\\nThe court added, “We also provide that the Committee shall ensure that devotees visit the shrine in moderate numbers as per routine in order to avoid the possibility of any stampede or unwarranted situation causing a concern to the safety of the devotees and creating difficulties for the administration.”\\n\\nThe court was hearing a bunch of petitions challenging the order issued on April 26 this year by the District Magistrate, Bahraich, declining permission for holding the annual Jeth Mela at and near the Dargah of Syed Sallar Masood Ghazi.\\n\\nThe court said, “As the prayer for organising ‘Jeth Mela’ having cultural/commercial trappings is concerned, we are not persuaded, prima facie, to interfere with the decision of the state authorities.”\\n\\nA previous court order had said the petitioners’ lawyer had made the key points about why the case should be admitted and interim relief granted. These points mentioned that the Dargah was established in 1375 AD by Firoz Shah Tuglaq in the memory of Syed Sallar Masood Ghazi. There is no requirement in law for seeking such permission, thus, there was no question of denying it, the lawyer submitted.\\n\\nThe reasons given in the impugned order are not at all germane to the holding of Urs/Mela. In fact, what is sought to be held is an Urs and not Mela. The Urs/Mela is being organised at the said place for the past several years. He relied upon documents on record pertaining to the last few years to contend that there has never been any law and order or other problem during the Urs, therefore, there is absolutely no basis nor justification for preventing organization of such Urs/Mela.',\n",

Mach’s principle states that the mass of every object in the universe is affected by its interaction with every other object was central to the Hoyle-Narlikar gravity theory.\\n\\n2. Einstein was greatly inspired by the principle and incorporated it into his theory.\\n\\n3. The Hoyle-Narlikar theory of gravity proposed a “creation field” (C-field), a hypothetical negative-energy field responsible for the continuous creation of matter.\\n\\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\\n\\n(a) 1 and 2 only\\n\\n(b) 2 only\\n\\n(c) 2 and 3 only\\n\\n(d) 1, 2 and 3\\n\\nExplanation\\n\\n— Jayant Narlikar, an eminent Indian astronomer, science communicator, and Padma Vibhushan recipient, died at the age of 87.\\n\\n— He was best known for proposing the Hoyle-Narlikar theory of gravity (also known as conformal gravity), which he developed in 1964 with English astronomer and professor Fred Hoyle. The hypothesis intended to improve upon Albert Einstein’s General hypothesis of Relativity, which was published in 1915.\\n\\n— Mach’s principle, which states that every object’s mass is changed by its interaction with every other object, is central to the Hoyle-Narlikar gravity theory. The notion profoundly intrigued Einstein, but he was unable to incorporate it into his theories. Hence, statement 1 is correct and statement 2 is not correct.\\n\\n— The Hoyle-Narlikar gravity theory also proposed a “creation field” (C-field), which is a hypothetical negative-energy field that is responsible for the continual formation of matter. This helps to explain the steady-state cosmology, which holds that the universe has no beginning and would exist indefinitely. Hence, statement 3 is correct.\\n\\n— The Hoyle-Narlikar theory of gravity was not widely accepted, particularly following the discovery of cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation in 1965. The CMB, also known as an echo or shockwave of the Big Bang, is a cooled remnant of the first light to flow freely throughout the cosmos.\\n\\nTherefore, option (a) is the correct answer.\\n\\nWhich of the following missions of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) have failed?\\n\\n1. EOS-07 mission\\n\\n2. Inaugural flight in 1993\\n\\n3. C-39 mission\\n\\nSelect the correct answer using the codes given below:\\n\\n(a) 1 only\\n\\n(b) 2 and 3 only\\n\\n(c) 1 and 3 only\\n\\n(d) 3 only\\n\\nExplanation\\n\\n— The Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO) 101st satellite launch failed. The Earth observation satellite EOS-09 was aboard the PSLV-C61 (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle).\\n\\n— This was the 63rd PSLV launch. Since their introduction in the 1990s, PSLVs have only failed twice – the first during the inaugural flight in 1993 and in 2017, when the C-39 mission was unsuccessful. Here is why PSLVs have become reliable for India’s Space agency and what happened during the two failed missions.\\n\\n— ISRO has three types of launchers: the PSLV, the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), and the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mk-III (LVM3). Variants are chosen based on the cargo weights and the orbit they will reach.\\n\\n— PSLV: Satellites used for navigation, mapping, or other functions must be transported into space by launch vehicles or rockets such as the PSLV. The rockets feature powerful propulsion systems that create massive amounts of energy, which is required to lift large things such as satellites into space while resisting the Earth’s gravitational pull.\\n\\nTherefore, option (b) is the correct answer.\\n\\nWith reference to the stars, consider the following statements:\\n\\n1. Regardless of duration, all stars survive by maintaining a balance between two competing forces: the inward pull of gravity and the outward pressure produced by nuclear energy.\\n\\n2. In the dense core of a star, nuclear fusion converts hydrogen into helium.\\n\\n3. When a star’s fuel is exhausted, gravity takes over — and then the nature of its death depends entirely on its mass.\\n\\nHow many of the statements given above are correct?\\n\\n(a) Only one\\n\\n(b) Only two\\n\\n(c) All three\\n\\n(d) None\\n\\nExplanation\\n\\n— The stars in the sky seem to shine forever, but they too are subject to lifespans determined by their mass and internal physics. Some last for billions of years and others are transitory in comparison, with far shorter lifetimes.\\n\\n— Regardless of duration, all stars survive by maintaining a balance between two competing forces: the inward pull of gravity and the outward pressure produced by nuclear energy. Hence, statement 1 is correct.\\n\\n— In the dense core of a star, nuclear fusion converts hydrogen into helium. This process occurs when extremely high temperatures and pressures allow atomic nuclei, which are ordinarily repelled by positive charges, to collide and fuse, releasing massive energy. That energy heats the surrounding gas, resulting in thermal and radiation pressure that prevents gravitational collapse. Hence, statement 2 is correct.\\n\\n— This beautiful explanation of how stars glow was not previously known. Only in 1938, while taking a train to Ithaca, New York, did German-American physicist Hans Bethe scribble down the equations detailing how nuclear fusion powers stars, a breakthrough that earned him the Nobel Prize and resolved one of astrophysics’ most pressing mysteries.\\n\\n— But even fusion has its limits. When a star’s fuel is exhausted, gravity takes over — and then the nature of its death depends entirely on its mass. Hence, statement 3 is correct.\\n\\nTherefore, option (c) is the correct answer.\\n\\nConsider the following statements about HeLa cells:\\n\\n1. They were the first successfully cloned human cells.\\n\\n2. These cells contributed to the identification of the Bovine Papillomaviruses (BPV) as the primary cause of many types of cervical cancer.\\n\\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\\n\\n(a) 1 only\\n\\n(b) 2 only\\n\\n(c) Both 1 and 2\\n\\n(d) Neither 1 nor 2\\n\\nExplanation\\n\\n— The HeLa cell line is one of the most important cell lines in the history of medical science and has been the foundation for some of the most significant advances in this field.\\n\\n— HeLa cells were the first successfully cloned human cells, and Jonas Salk used them to test the polio vaccine. Hence, statement 1 is correct.\\n\\n— Furthermore, they contributed to the identification of the human papillomavirus (HPV) as the primary cause of many types of cervical cancer, including the one that killed Lacks, and were instrumental in the development of the HPV vaccine, which earned its creator, Harald zur Hausen, the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2008. Hence, statement 2 is not correct.\\n\\nTherefore, option (a) is the correct answer.\\n\\nWith reference to the JN.1 variant of COVID, consider the following statements:\\n\\n1. It is a sub-lineage of the Omicron variant.\\n\\n2. This variant is distinguished by its heightened transmissibility and potential to evade immune responses, even in the vaccinated population.\\n\\n3. JN.1 is most likely to affect the elderly individual and those with underlying health conditions.\\n\\nWhich of the statements given above are correct?\\n\\n(a) 1 and 2 only\\n\\n(b) 2 and 3 only\\n\\n(c) 1 and 3 only\\n\\n(d) 1, 2 and 3\\n\\nExplanation\\n\\n— The JN.1 variant is not entirely new, it is a sub-lineage of the Omicron variant that has been circulating globally for some time.\\n\\n— This version is distinguished by its heightened transmissibility and potential to evade immune responses, even in the vaccinated population, according to Dr Harish Chafle, senior consultant, intensivist chest physician, bronchoscopist, and sleep disorders expert at Gleneagles Hospital in Parel, Mumbai. Hence, statement 2 is correct.\\n\\n— JN.1 is a sublineage of the Omicron type that is currently being closely monitored by the World Health Organisation. Hence, statement 1 is correct.\\n\\n— JN.1 is most likely to impact people with low immune systems, the elderly, and those who have pre-existing health issues.Children and healthy adults may also get the virus, but they are likely to recover without significant consequences. Hence, statement 3 is correct.\\n\\nTherefore, option (d) is the correct answer.\\n\\nDaily Subject-wise quiz — History, Culture, and Social Issues (Week 111)\\n\\nDaily subject-wise quiz — Polity and Governance (Week 111)\\n\\nDaily subject-wise quiz — Science and Technology (Week 110)\\n\\nDaily subject-wise quiz — Economy (Week 110)\\n\\nDaily subject-wise quiz — Environment and Geography (Week 110)\\n\\nDaily subject-wise quiz – International Relations (Week 110)\\n\\nSubscribe to our UPSC newsletter and stay updated with the news cues from the past week.\\n\\nStay updated with the latest UPSC articles by joining our Telegram channel – IndianExpress UPSC Hub, and follow us on Instagram and X.',\n",
       "  'Male lion stalks cubs; what the mother lioness does next leaves Internet in awe: ‘No greater warrior than a mother’\\n\\nA lioness and her sister sprang into action when they spotted a male lion approaching their cubs.\\n\\n“God can’t be everywhere, so he created mothers.” We’ve all heard this saying, and every now and then, we witness something that reminds us why it rings so true. A heart-stopping moment recently captured in Serengeti’s Maasai Kopjes proves just how fierce and fearless mothers can be, even in the wild.\\n\\nIn a now-viral video, a lioness and her sister sprang into action when they spotted a male lion approaching their cubs. Without hesitation, they ran straight towards him, warning him to stay away. The protective instinct was raw, powerful, and absolutely unshakable.\\n\\nPhotographer Venkat Krishnan, who shared the dramatic footage on Instagram, described it as “one of the most epic arguments we have seen in the wild!”\\n\\n“This lioness and her sister charged at the male who was following the family with small cubs and the mothers clearly didn’t want the male coming close to the cubs. It was incredible how the mothers saw the male climb up the Kopje from a distance and ran towards him to confront him,” he wrote in the caption.\\n\\nA post shared by Venkat Krishnan (@venkat_krishnan22)\\n\\nThe video quickly garnered attention online, racking up over a million views. In the comments, people couldn’t stop praising the lionesses’ bravery. A user commented, “It was proven once again that there is no greater warrior in the world than a mother.”\\n\\nAnother user commented, “Wow!! This gave me goosebumps all over my entire body. Lioness FAFO in action.”\\n\\nA third user wrote, “You can hear the moment his sounds changed to be less aggressive. His face changes too like he knew he was NOT going to fight that fight!”\\n\\nA fourth user gave a “Lion King” reference, saying, “It’s the epic showdown against Scar on Pride Rock.”\\n\\nThis isn’t the only recent display of maternal courage from the animal kingdom. In Kenya’s Maasai Mara, another video went viral showing a buffalo calf surrounded by a pride of lions. Just as one lion moved in, the mother charged with her horns down, putting herself between danger and her baby. Against all odds, she fought back, circling her calf, daring the predators to come closer.',\n",

The Bhaskara foyer, which usually echoes scientific discussions and footsteps of young scholars, stood draped in silence and reverence as his mortal remains were placed for the public to pay their final respects.\\n\\nFriends, colleagues, admirers, and students gathered to bid farewell to the legendary astrophysicist whose work bridged Indian science with the global cosmos. His influence was felt in every tearful gaze and bowed head.\\n\\nThe ‘salami shastra’ (general salute) followed by ‘shok satra salami’ and two minutes of silence also marked the solemn occasion.\\n\\nMaharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar paid floral tributes to Narlikar.\\n\\n“We have lost a great scientist and an equally great writer. I pay my heartfelt tribute to him,” Fadnavis wrote on X.\\n\\nSavitribai Phule Pune University Vice-Chancellor Dr Suresh Gosavi said, “Prof Narlikar was not just a scientist, but an academic visionary who helped shape the culture of research in Pune. His presence will always remain in the very spirit of IUCAA,” he said.\\n\\nKiran Mehta, who has admired Narlikar’s journey for more than 40 years, recalled, “He had an option to settle there when he was in Cambridge, but he chose to come back to India and light up here. He simplified the universe for us and showed us how to ask questions.”\\n\\nAlso among the diverse crowd was Akhila, a PhD scholar who worked under Narlikar’s guidance. “He had a great time in his life and he made sure others had a great time. IUCAA is a hub for all universities to work together,” she said.\\n\\nAnother student, Priya, said, “He made science human. He encouraged us to think freely and without fear.”\\n\\nPrakash Bhosale, “I was his friend and a student too. We used chit-chat after classes. Everything I am today is because of him. He was my idol in this world,” he said, eyes welling up. “He will stay forever with us.”\\n\\nAs the final rites began, the sun rose higher, casting a golden light over the Bhaskara foyer–a fitting tribute to the man who brought the stars closer to us all.\\n\\nNarlikar passed away in Pune on Tuesday at age 87.

       "  'China This Week | China comments on India-Pakistan ceasefire, clinches tariff deal with US\\n\\nEvery Friday, we recap highlights of the week’s news from China. This week, China lent support to Pakistan following the ceasefire, released a list of Chinese names for places in Arunachal Pradesh and held a summit with Caribbean and Latin American nations. Here are 4 key developments.\\n\\nIt’s almost a week since India and Pakistan declared a ceasefire on May 10. As detailed in our last tracker, China has been commenting on Operation Sindoor, saying both countries were its neighbours and that it was “willing to continue playing a constructive role in this regard”.\\n\\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke to his Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar and with India’s National Security Adviser Ajit Doval. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif lauded China’s support for Pakistan. Notably, Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs commented on the events.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, India rejected a list of Chinese names for places in Arunachal Pradesh, for attempting to alter the “undeniable” reality of the state being an integral part of India. China, which describes Arunachal Pradesh as “South Tibet”, has engaged in this practice periodically since 2017. We wrote about it in an explainer here.\\n\\nOver the last weekend, the United States and China took a major step forward in their tariff war. Substantial tariff reductions were announced, which brought relief to markets and businesses in both countries.\\n\\nHere’s a look at four key developments.\\n\\nWang told Doval that China condemned “the terrorist attacks in Pahalgam area and opposes all forms of terrorism”. To Dar, however, he said Pakistan was “standing at the forefront of the international fight against terrorism” and had “made important contributions to counterterrorism efforts”.\\n\\nA few hours after the ceasefire went into force on May 10, Sharif in a speech called China a “very dear, very trustworthy, and very dear friend”. China, he said, has “always been there in the times when Pakistan needed them and they have never even acknowledged the loss or profit”; “always been there for Pakistan’s support and integrity”.\\n\\nOn May 12, India acknowledged China’s role for the first time since Operation Sindoor began. During a press briefing, Air Marshal A K Bharti, Director General Air Operations, presented visual evidence of a piece of the Chinese-made PL-15 long-range missile that India’s air defences had shot down.\\n\\nTaiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also commented on the tensions on May 10. In a statement, it expressed “firm support for all legitimate and necessary actions taken by the Government of India to safeguard national security and fight terrorist forces that cross borders to attack innocent civilians.”\\n\\nUPSHOT: The Chinese government’s official comments, as well as stories on its state-backed media outlets in recent days, have lent support to Pakistan’s narrative. There is little mention of\\n\\nPakistan’s known links to terror groups or China’s part in blocking UN designations of terrorists, and Pakistan has expressed its gratitude in response.\\n\\nTaiwan’s response figures among the strongest statements globally in favour of India. Regarded as a “renegade province” by China, the island has sought to assert its independence from the mainland in the last decade or so.\\n\\nIndia and Taiwan do not enjoy a full diplomatic relationship, as China deems recognition of its claims over Taiwan as a precondition for diplomatic ties. However, India and Taiwan have limited engagement, including on trade.\\n\\n2. Tariff deal with the US\\n\\nAhead of talks in Switzerland between the trade representatives of China and the United States over the weekend, expectations were measured. It was assumed that the triple-digit tariffs both countries imposed on each other would fall slightly, but the final result went much further.\\n\\nCurrently, the US has a 30% tariff on Chinese goods, down from 145%. Of this, 10% is the flat rate applicable to all countries. The remaining 20% is for China’s alleged role in supplying the deadly opioid fentanyl to the US.\\n\\nChina’s own 10% retaliatory tariff on the US over fentanyl continues, but it is far less than the earlier 125%.\\n\\nAn official mechanism was announced on Monday to ensure dialogue between the representatives of the two countries, led by US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng.\\n\\nThe Chinese representative repeated China’s oft-stated view that “There are no winners in a trade war”, and that “China does not want a trade war, but is not afraid of one.” Bessent struck a conciliatory tone, saying the aim was to secure a long-term trade deal, and that “neither side wants to decouple”.\\n\\nUPSHOT: Both sides needed a reduction in tariffs owing to their huge economic dependence on one another. The total US-China goods trade stood at $582 billion in 2024.\\n\\nOne obstacle, for the time being, is the fentanyl issue. It is among the biggest causes of deaths due to drug overdoses in the US. China has often blamed the US’s domestic problems and inefficiencies for its supply in the country. This, even as reports have pointed to the drug’s precursor chemicals being produced in China and sent to Mexico for production.\\n\\nIn the past, the US and China have collaborated on the issue, despite lows in other aspects of their relationship.\\n\\n3. Central bank attempts to boost liquidity\\n\\nChina’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China, cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by 0.5 percentage points for financial institutions on Thursday. This effectively reduces the amount they are expected to hold, and could free up about 1 trillion yuan ($138.77 billion) in long-term liquidity into the market.\\n\\nThe Communist Party mouthpiece Global Times said that earlier this month, the bank announced plans for monetary policies to enhance macroeconomic regulation, including lowering the lending policy rate.\\n\\nUPSHOT: Beginning in September 2024, the Chinese government has introduced stimulus packages and policies to put more money in the hands of the people. These include increasing pay for government workers in January and a 10 trillion yuan ($1.36 trillion) debt package for local\\n\\ngovernments in November 2024. Some analysts said the latter was inadequate, and that more direct measures are needed to spur consumer spending.\\n\\nThe concerns around low domestic consumption in China have been raised for years now, even before the Covid-19 pandemic. With the added threat of Trump’s tariffs, turning inwards was seen as an alternative.\\n\\n4. New BRI deal, outreach to Latin America\\n\\nOn Wednesday, China signed a joint cooperation plan with Colombia for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), its flagship infrastructure funding scheme.\\n\\nA day prior, Xi also held talks with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in Beijing. The leaders were present in Beijing for the three-yearly China-CELAC (Community of Latin American and Caribbean States) Forum Ministerial Meeting. The regional forum includes 32 countries.\\n\\nChina announced it would give $9.18 billion in credit to CELAC members. In a speech, Chinese President Xi Jinping underlined that China and CELAC nations were “important members of the Global South.”\\n\\nHe also said China would import more from Latin America and encourage its firms to boost investment. Already, China has looked to Brazil for agricultural imports, in part to reduce its dependence on the US for products such as soybeans.\\n\\nUPSHOT: Despite criticism over its high costs and sustainability in many parts of the world, the BRI continues to sign on new partners, given China’s standing as a source of funds.\\n\\nChina’s outreach in what is traditionally seen as the US’s regional backyard also matters from a strategic perspective. Notably, Panama announced its decision to exit the BRI in February, which followed several statements from Trump and other US officials about Chinese presence in the country.\\n\\nAnother aspect is that Caribbean nations, including Haiti and Saint Lucia, are among the handful of countries worldwide that still accord diplomatic recognition to Taiwan. Both their representatives were in attendance at the summit.\\n\\nChina has utilised its economic influence and the promise of trade over the decades to get countries to give up official ties with Taiwan.\\n\\nRishika Singh is a Senior sub-editor at the Explained Desk of The Indian Express.

       "  'Waqf boards perform secular functions, false narrative being created on waqf-by-user: SG to top court\\n\\nNo basis to say that govt can take over waqf land, Act only provides for change in revenue records: Tushar Mehta\\n\\nThe Union government on Wednesday told the Supreme Court that waqf, though an Islamic concept, is not an essential feature of the religion and that waqf boards are performing secular functions.\\n\\nSolicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta, appearing for the government, also told a bench of Chief Justice of India B R Gavai and Justice Augustine G Masih that a “false narrative” was being created that documents would be demanded to prove waqfs established by long use (waqf-by-user).\\n\\nThe court is hearing the challenge against the amendments to the Waqf Act.\\n\\nMehta said: “Waqf is an Islamic concept. But it is not an essential part of Islam. Waqf is nothing but just charity in Islam. Charity is recognised in every religion, and it cannot be regarded as an essential tenet of any religion.”\\n\\n“Even certain practices adopted by the person professing a particular religion may not have anything to do with the religion itself. I am posing a question to myself. Suppose a majority of the Muslims, who are not financially sound, if they do not create a waqf, would they cease to be Muslims? That’s the test the Supreme Court has laid down,” the SG argued. “Charity is a part of every religion, but not an essential part of any religion. And therefore, waqf per se is not an essential religious practice.”\\n\\nOn the Act providing for non-Muslim members in Waqf Boards, Mehta argued that these bodies performed secular functions. “Secular function means in every state they would see that if there are hundred waqfs, those are properly maintained… The functions of the waqf board, it’s purely secular.”\\n\\nMehta said the law provides for a maximum of two non-Muslim members on a board, whose majority would still be Muslim. He added that unlike Hindu endowments, the work of Waqf Boards does not touch upon any religious activity.\\n\\nThe SG said that Article 25 allows the state to make any law regulating or restricting any economic, financial, political or other secular activities that may be associated with religious practice.\\n\\n“So administration of property will have to be in accordance with law. In other words, the competent legislature has the competence to enact the law with regard to administration of such property without touching upon the religious part of it,” he said.\\n\\nThe SG also referred to the top court permitting the Tamil Nadu government to appoint priests in temples calling it a secular activity, and said many such provisions enacted by states are under challenge before the court.\\n\\nMehta also spoke on the apprehensions raised by the petitioners about Section 3C of the Act, which says that a “property shall not be treated as waqf property” till a designated officer completes an inquiry on whether it encroached upon government land. The SG said this Section only provides for an entry to be made in revenue records as the question of title can be determined only by a court of law.\\n\\nThere is no basis, therefore, to say that the government can unilaterally take over waqf land, he said.\\n\\n“The only consequence is that revenue records will be corrected… The argument repeated by them is that this provision allows the wholesale takeover of the waqf. It is misleading. Designated Officer is not making a final determination of property — only the revenue records will be updated. It is only that through revenue records, it will come to notice that the property belongs to the government… It will be open for affected parties to approach the waqf tribunal. Final determination of title would be decided by tribunal or on appeal by the High Courts,” he said.\\n\\nHe denied that Section 3C enabled the government to act as a judge in its own cause, saying the government is not the owner of any property but only holds it in trust for 140 crore Indians.\\n\\nOn the need to register waqf-by-user properties, the SG said that even the Mussalman Wakf Act of 1923 had a provision (Section 3) mandating such registration of waqfs. “Now it is not open for anyone to say waqf need not be registered,” he said.\\n\\nMehta will continue his arguments on Thursday.',\n",
       "  'Advantage Gujarat Titans against Starc-less Delhi Capitals\\n\\nThe Mukesh vs. Gill match-up could be an enticing watch, while KL Rahul’s battle against Krishna could be another key duel.\\n\\nIt’s perhaps fair to say that being on the receiving end of Mitchell Starc’s feisty yorkers would never be a batter’s first choice in any condition. The Player of the Match in last year’s final and Qualifier 1 has continued to deliver strong returns for his new franchise Delhi Capitals, despite having his salary nearly halved for this season. But he hasn’t returned for the concluding leg of the IPL.\\n\\nThis season, Starc had single-handedly spearheaded Delhi Capitals’ pace attack on the mostly placid surface at the Arun Jaitley Stadium. With 14 wickets – Delhi’s highest- he sits 10th in the leading wicket-takers list. The next-best pacer for Delhi, Mukesh Kumar, has managed nine scalps, four of which came in a single innings against Lucknow Super Giants.\\n\\nBut with the IPL’s resumption post one week halt due to the escalating tensions between India and Pakistan and his wife and Australia captain Alyssa Healy recently describing the situation in Dharamsala as “terrifying,” a hesitant Starc, who flew back to Australia, chose to miss out on the remainder of the season. “There was a lot of anxiety around the Australian group because we didn’t have a whole heap of information as to what was going on,” Healy said on the Willow Talk podcast. “That’s probably been the really interesting and probably the scariest part of this whole situation, the misinformation,” she added.\\n\\nIn the Aussie veteran’s absence, Delhi find themselves in a precarious position as they take on Gujarat Titans in a crucial home fixture on Sunday. The desperation led to the signing of Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman in place of Jake-Fraser McGurk, who had also decided against a return to India.\\n\\nWhile the left-arm seamer with slingy action, Mustafizur’s death bowling offers DC fans some hope, Starc’s pedigree is just irreplaceable. “It’s very tough to replace someone like Mitchell Starc, but this is a fresh start,” said DC all-rounder Vipraj Nigam, who has impressed with both bat and ball for DC. “We’ve regrouped and made a few changes. Basically, we’re looking to restart the season the way we began initially,” he said on the match eve.\\n\\nMustafizur, who received an NOC from Bangladesh late on Friday, will also be unavailable for the match against Gujarat as he features in the first T20I against UAE. While opener Faf du Plessis and Tristan Stubbs are back in the mix, the South African middle-order batter and Delhi’s mainstay, Stubbs, will leave after the league stage, in preparation for Proteas’ World Test Championship final against Australia.\\n\\nCompounding Delhi’s worries is their poor home form. Barring Starc’s Super Over heroics against Rajasthan Royals, Axar Patel’s side is yet to win a game on their home turf. Delhi now need three wins in their remaining three matches to secure a top-four spot without relying on other results.\\n\\nWhile Delhi scrambles for replacements, Gujarat could soon face a similar dilemma, provided they secure a playoff spot. Their English talisman, Jos Buttler, is set to return home for national duty. An astute figure with multi-dimensional skills — a match-winner with bat, an able wicket keeper, and part of the leadership group — Buttler’s absence will leave a significant void. Despite having one foot already in the playoffs, Gujarat must address their team balance with the Ashish Nehra-Shubman Gill duo needing to find a way to compensate for Buttler’s loss, especially for a top-heavy side like GT. The 2022 winners have roped in Sri Lankan wicket-keeper batter Kusal Mendis as a like-for-like replacement.\\n\\nAlthough their rain-interrupted, last-ball thriller win against Mumbai Indians masked their inexperienced middle order, GT remains heavily reliant on their top three: Gill, Sai Sudharsan, and Buttler.\\n\\nThe triumvirate has done heavy lifting for Gujarat, accounting for scoring over 71 per cent runs by themselves. GT’s dismissal rate (average balls faced per wicket) of 24 is the highest among all 10 teams. Their scoring rate of 10 runs per over (2130 runs in 212.5 overs) also ranks at the top.\\n\\n“Right now, the focus is on his availability for the next three games. We’ll then assess team balance and combinations,” said GT assistant coach Parthiv Patel. “Buttler has been a great performer … the leader of the group.”\\n\\nIn the bowling department, Prasidh Krishna and Mohammed Siraj have been phenomenal for Gujarat. Krishna, the purple cap holder with 20 scalps in 11 matches, has been a revelation, striking early with the new ball while maintaining his impact in the death overs as well.\\n\\nThe Mukesh vs. Gill match-up could be an enticing one to follow, while KL Rahul’s battle against Krishna could be another key duel to watch.',\n",
       "  'Samantha Prabhu asks PCOS nutritionist about key signs that indicate estrogen dominance: ‘When your breasts feel…’\\n\\nStress management through mindfulness, meditation, or yoga can also contribute to hormonal stability\\n\\nSamantha Ruth Prabhu, a self-proclaimed wellness advocate, often uses her social media platforms to spread awareness and valuable information regarding public health. In a recent conversation with PCOS and endometriosis-focused nutritionist Rashi Chowdhary, the Citadel: Honey Bunny actor unearthed the risks and pitfalls of developing estrogen dominance in your body.\\n\\nWhen Samantha asked how one can find out if there is estrogen dominance in the body, Chowdhary replied: “When your breasts feel heavy, you are experiencing acne, you feel like you are not losing weight, you have a thyroid problem, chances are your estrogen is high.”\\n\\n“If you bleed too much or there are clots in your blood, that’s a hallmark sign of high estrogen,” added the expert.\\n\\nAccording to Rashi Chowdhary, an excess of estrogen in the body can also manifest as the following symptoms:\\n\\nConcurring, Dr Mahesh D M, Consultant – Endocrinology, Aster CMI Hospital, Bangalore, said such a condition occurs when estrogen levels in the body are disproportionately high relative to other hormones, especially progesterone. “Common conditions thought to be associated with or exacerbated by estrogen dominance include fibroids, endometriosis, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS),” he continued.\\n\\nA post shared by Rashi Chowdhary (@rashichowdhary)\\n\\nDr Geetha P, senior consultant, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, KIMSHEALTH, Thiruvananthapuram, told indianexpress.com that the “greatest problem of estrogen dominance is that it increases the risk of breast cancer in women”.\\n\\nDr Geetha recommended avoiding having fatty food like fried items, sweets, chocolates, ice creams and all things made from maida (flour) that can increase fat. “This excess fat causes unnecessary production of estrogen, which eventually ends up in the ovary, stimulates it and leads to a dominance,” she explained.\\n\\nThe gynaecologist also advised regular exercise, and staying away from excess estrogen supplementation during menopause or perimenopause, since it can lead to endometrial hyperplasia (abnormally thick uterus (endometrium) due to hormonal imbalances) and breast-related diseases.\\n\\n“Besides exercise and weight loss, isoflavones such as soy and flaxseed, omega-3 fatty acids, green tea polyphenols, and broccoli derivatives are some natural interventions that can play a powerful role in rebalancing hormone levels,” said Dr Mahesh. Stress management through mindfulness, meditation, or yoga can also contribute to hormonal stability, he revealed.\\n\\nDISCLAIMER: This article is based on information from the public domain and/or the experts we spoke to.

       "  'Sai Sudharsan interview: ‘Last year, I was a bit slow … changed mindset, shots’\\n\\nSudharsan is the hottest young player in the IPL, also tipped to feature in the Test tour of England. He talks about the changes he made in his game from last season.\\n\\nIt’s a diary entry that Sai Sudharsan made after a IPL game against Chennai Super Kings at the end of the last season that marks the improvement in his batting and captures why the 23-year old is the talk of the town this year in a league filled with flamboyant hitters.\\n\\nHe had matched Shubman Gill shot for shot on that night in Ahmedabad in a 51-ball 103 knock, but he wasn’t entirely satisfied. After a long deliberation, he wrote something on these lines: ‘There is scope to push myself harder and be explosive’.\\n\\nIn what is turning out into an incredible season for Gujarat Titans, Sai Sudharsan is leading their batting charts with 509 runs from 11 innings. While he tallied 527 runs last season as well and even scored a century and averaged more, the noticeable change is in the strike-rate column. This season he has been striking at 153.31, 12 more than last season and 10 more than his career strike-rate. And the best part of all it has been that he has been able to do it without deviating from his game and not compromising on his compact technique.\\n\\n“Last year, in certain innings, I was a bit slow,” Sai Sudharsan tells The Indian Express. “The pitches that we played also were a bit different to the others. And even the team situation was such that there were no great starts. We kept losing wickets and I wasn’t able to give good starts. I was slow to get off the block.\\n\\n“I realised that I’d have to push myself more; be a bit more explosive. So I went home and worked on the mindset of it. As you said, I didn’t change anything with my batting, but just brought more clarity. I wanted to bring the explosive element very early in the innings. If I could do it later, I could definitely do it at the beginning as well from ball one. From there on, I practiced with these thoughts in mind,” the left-hander says.\\n\\nThat the Tamil Nadu Premier League followed soon after did help Sai Sudharsan to an extent. At TNPL, he began to bring this element to his batting.\\n\\n“The idea to be a bit more positive started at the TNPL. Even before last season’s IPL was done, I remember asking myself how we should play next year and what should I do to take my batting forward. I definitely had ideas to add more elements to my batting. I wanted to see what it brings to my game. The mindset had to change. When the TNPL happened, it didn’t start well, but by the end I was able to see the difference. Unless you go through that grind and test yourself, you don’t know the ceiling you can reach,” Sai Sudharsan says.\\n\\nIn previous seasons, pacers had found a way to tie him down, particularly with those lines that denied him room to free his arms. Having largely depended on conventional shots, this season Sai Sudharsan has brought out the paddle shot, which has been an effective scoring shot.\\n\\n“Definitely it is one of the vital shots that I have used in white ball or T20 cricket for sure. What it brings to your game is even if a bowler is delivering his best ball, you are able to score off it to a less protected pocket in the field. So when you have that sort of an option for a bowler’s go-to delivery, you are invariably putting him under pressure. He is pushed into doing something different. That was the reason behind it (adding to his shotbook).”\\n\\nEven against spinners, Sai Sudharsan has shown how his range has only widened. While he mostly targeted the mid-wicket pocket for lofted shots, a lofted drive is a new addition this time alongside the reverse-sweeps.\\n\\n“The lofted shot is primarily because of the length most of them operate. You have to bring some explosive ways to disrupt the bowler. Otherwise, they will keep bowling that good length which you can’t do much about. So I thought of ways to disturb them or else you are playing to their tempo. And when you allow that, the pressure falls on myself. When you have more options for a delivery, you have your nose in front,” he explains.\\n\\nHaving mostly batted at No 3 in the previous three seasons, this edition is the first instance of Sai Sudharsan has started every game as an opener forming a left-right combo with Gill. Though he has been an opener right through, the Chennai lad tapped in on Gill and Jos Buttler to learn the tactical nuances. “In terms of the mindset and how to take the game deep, I did have conversations with Jos and Gill because I’d not opened a lot in the IPL. This is the first time I’ve started as an opener — so wanted to know how one has to transition from powerplay to the middle overs and beyond,” he says.\\n\\nIn the race for Orange Cap, there are five players who have touched 500 or more runs this season with 10 runs being the gap between the one at the top and at No 5. Sai Sudharsan is at second spot, just one run behind Suryakumar Yadav with Gill, Virat Kohli and Buttler following on his heels. The Orange Cap though isn’t in Sai Sudharsan’s mind.\\n\\n“It always feels great for sure to be in a race with such great players. But I am not thinking about it. I am thinking of it as a by-product to the things I’m doing right. Of course, the desire and hunger to get it is there for sure. But at the same time, that is not the main priority. The priority is to do the best for the team and if you get this while doing so, I would take it with both my hands.”',\n",
       "  'An engineer by training, behind most audacious Naxal attacks: Story & significance of Basavaraju, dreaded Maoist leader allegedly killed in encounter\\n\\nBasavaraju took over from the former CPI (Maoist) general secretary Mupalla Laxman Rao alias Ganpathy sometime in 2017. Some in the security establishment believe that his killing could mark the beginning of the end of the movement in India.\\n\\nIn perhaps the most successful security operation in decades against the Maoists, security forces on Wednesday (May 21) claimed to have killed CPI (Maoist) general secretary Nambala Keshava Rao alias Basavaraju along with 27 other Naxal cadres in an encounter in Chhattisgarh.\\n\\nSources in the security establishment said this could be critical moment in the fight against Naxals, and that the forces may actually be able to meet the deadline set by union Home Minister Amit Shah for ending the Maoist insurgency by March next year.\\n\\nA former military commander of the movement, Basavaraju took over from the former general secretary Mupalla Laxman Rao alias Ganpathy sometime in 2017 owing to the latter’s ill health. However, the CPI (Maoist) announced this change only in 2018.\\n\\nIn a press statement dated November 10, 2018, the Maoists announced that Mupalla Laxman Rao alias Ganapathy had “withdrawn from his responsibilities”, and the new general secretary was Nambala Keshava Rao alias Basavaraju.\\n\\nThis was the first change in the leadership of the movement in 14 years. Ganpathy had been its supreme leader for 25 years — 12 years as chief of the CPI (ML) People’s War and 13 years as chief of the CPI (Maoist) following the merger of the People’s War and the Maoist Communist Centre (MCC).\\n\\nUntil he took over the party as chief, Basavaraju was practically the No. 2. He was the Commander in Chief of the Central Military Commission (CMC) of the Maoists, and was responsible for all attacks and ambushes on security forces over the past decade and a half.\\n\\nHe looked after both intelligence and operations, and was the head of the forest division of the Dandakaranya in the past. He also was a member of the CPI (Maoist) Politburo (the top ideological think tank of the party), a member of the Standing Committee, part of the Central Committee, and a member of the editorial board of the party publication Awam-e-Jung.\\n\\nSecurity agencies have had very sketchy details of Basavaraju, the “ferocious and brutal revolutionary”, beyond his student days.\\n\\nBorn in an ordinary family at Jiyanapeta, Srikakulam, Andhra Pradesh, on July 10, 1955, Basavaraju went on to do a B Tech from the Regional Engineering College in Warangal. This trained engineer was also very good in sports – and represented Andhra Pradesh at the national level in volleyball.\\n\\nThese were also days when Basavaraju got involved in leftist student politics, and was arrested in 1980 following a scuffle with ABVP members. That was the only time he had ever been arrested.\\n\\nSoon afterward, Basavaraju joined the People’s War. This association with left-wing extremism (LWE) would continue for the next 35 years.\\n\\nAccording to intelligence agencies, Basavaraju is about 6 feet tall, and has a wheatish complexion. An intelligence document accessed by The Indian Express describes him as a “clean shaven man who now dyes his hair regularly”. He “lives in Maad (Abujhmaad) and AOB Zonal Committee area”, and carries an AK 47. “He walks briskly and swings either side while walking,” the document says.\\n\\nThe document also says that Ganpathy had been grooming him for the top leadership post for years, and had even accompanied him to Parasnath Hills in Giridih in November-December 2013 for a meeting.\\n\\nBasavaraju carried a reward of Rs 2.02 crore on his head. Ganpathy himself carries a reward of more than Rs 3 crore on his head.\\n\\nGANAPATHY: Ganapathy was a teacher before he joined the Maoist movement. He has been the ideological fountainhead and the political brain of the CPI (Maoist), and has steered the broad policies of the party since its inception. Ganapathy is regarded as a pragmatic leader with a degree of acceptability across LWE parties.\\n\\nGanapathy used to work under Kondapally Seetharamaiah, the founder of the People’s War. In 1992, Ganapathy toppled him, and was elected General Secretary. He oversaw the merger of the People’s War with the MCC, and was again elected General Secretary.\\n\\nHis core concerns and roles have been spreading the influence of the party in new areas, maintaining contact with and guiding overground front organisations, keeping in touch with like-minded political parties, establishing infrastructure for logistical support and legal help for cadres.\\n\\nBASAVARAJU: As CMC chief first and later General Secretary of the CPI (Maoist), Basavaraju was responsible for planning operations, targeting security forces, and recruiting dalam cadres. He had the blessings of Ganapathy when he was chosen to lead the People’s Liberation Guerilla Army.\\n\\nBasavaraju was known as an aggressive military commander who had presided over some of the most audacious and brutal attacks in the history of the Maoist movement. He was regarded as an expert in IEDs, and was a master military strategist.\\n\\nIt is said it was his brain that lay behind the 2013 Latehar ambush in Jharkhand, when a photosensitive IED was planted in the belly of a dead CRPF man with the expectation that rescue teams and doctors would suffer casualties.\\n\\nBasavaraju was also regarded as someone who could “tolerate some collateral damage” in terms of civilian lives if it meant a big success against security forces.\\n\\nWhen he took over the leadership of the CPI (Maoist), Basavaraju, with his considerable combat experience, was expected to make the outfit more lethal and combative. He did, indeed, embark on that path after taking over – guiding several lethal attacks on security forces.\\n\\nBut his leadership also saw the decline of the movement and serious setbacks for the Maoists. Security forces have not only killed hundreds of LWE cadres and leaders in the past few years, but have also advanced deep into Maoist core areas.\\n\\nSome of the major attacks that took place under Basavaraju’s leadership include:\\n\\n2018 Sukma IED attack: Maoists detonated an IED targeting a mine-protected vehicle carrying CRPF troops. Nine CRPF personnel were killed and six injured.\\n\\n2019 Gadchiroli landmine blast: A landmine explosion targeted a police vehicle hours after Maoists torched vehicles at a road construction site in Maharashtra’s Vidarbha region. As many as 15 police personnel and a driver were killed.\\n\\n2021 Sukma-Bijapur ambush: Security forces were ambushed during an anti-Maoist operation, leading to a prolonged firefight. As many as 22 security personnel were killed and 32 injured.\\n\\n2023 Dantewada IED blast: An IED explosion targeted a vehicle returning from an anti-Maoist operation. 10 DRG personnel and 1 civilian driver were killed.\\n\\n2025 Bijapur IED attack: A powerful IED explosion targeted a vehicle returning from an anti-Maoist operation. Eight DRG personnel and a civilian driver were killed.\\n\\nThe major reverses suffered by the Maoists under him include:\\n\\n2024 Kanker encounter: Security forces engaged Maoist cadres in a significant encounter, resulting in substantial rebel casualties. As many as 29 Maoists were killed, three security personnel were injured.\\n\\n2024 Abujhmad clash: This was one of the deadliest encounters for the Maoists, which significantly weakened their presence in the region. Thirty-eight Maoists were killed; one security personnel was injured.',\n",

Touted as a “SuperApp”, Swarail combines nearly all services offered by IRCTC under a single, modern interface, making it a major upgrade over the ageing IRCTC Rail Connect app.\\n\\nThe app is now available for download on both the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. Although it’s currently in beta, users can log in using their existing IRCTC Rail Connect accounts or create a new one.\\n\\nSwarail lets you book reserved, unreserved and platform tickets, eliminating the hassle of getting and waiting in a long line. To book a reserved or unreserved ticket, tap on the option of your choice and on the screen that appears, simply enter the source and destination station, set a date and choose the class you want to travel in. When you hit the search button, the app will show you a list of trains just like the IRCTC website.\\n\\nUnlike other railway apps, which are quite dated and buggy, Swarail has a pretty modern interface that makes it easy for users to avail the services they want without having to go through several clicks.

       "  'Opinion Water wars and signing of Indus Waters Treaty\\n\\nThe IWT, which survived four wars, decades of cross-border terrorism against India by Pakistan and opposition in India for over 64 years, was finally placed in abeyance on April 23, 2025, a day after 26 men were shot dead by terrorists in a Pahalgam meadow.\\n\\nOn September 19, 1960, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Mohammad Ayub Khan, then Pakistan President, signed the historic Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in Karachi. This was the second major pact with Pakistan since its creation, the first being the Nehru-Noon pact of October 1958 on East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).\\n\\nThe IWT, which survived four wars, decades of cross-border terrorism against India by Pakistan and opposition in India for over 64 years, was finally placed in abeyance on April 23, 2025, a day after 26 men were shot dead by terrorists in a Pahalgam meadow.\\n\\nWater disputes between the two nations date back to Partition, starting with the contentious division of resources across the Indus river system. For instance, the Depalpur canal was given to Pakistan, while the control of the headworks (a structure at the head or diversion point of a waterway) that fed the canal, the Ferozepur Headworks, went to India.\\n\\nTo resolve the dispute over supply of water to the Central Bari Doab and Depalpur canals in Pakistan’s West Punjab by East Punjab, Nehru and Malik Ghulam Mohammad, then Pakistan Finance Minister, signed the Inter-Dominion Accord in New Delhi on May 4, 1948. The accord stated that India would allow waters to areas in Pakistan under the Sutlej, which it had been enjoying for a long time, before its supply was gradually reduced and Pakistan made alternative arrangements. This accord too had its own bitter history.\\n\\nBefore signing the May 1948 pact, Pakistan was secretly trying to construct a channel upstream of Ferozepur to divert the Sutlej waters. Had this subterfuge not been detected in time, some of the Indian canals would have run dry. In protest, India started constructing the Harike Barrage in Ferozepur to ensure that waters would be available to its eastern and Bikaner canals. In response, Pakistan started building the Bambanwala-Ravi-Bedian-Dipalpur canal.\\n\\nAs relations between two nations worsened due to water-related issues, Pakistan proposed approaching the Security Council and the International Court of Justice — a plan rejected by India. It was at this stage in 1951 that the World Bank offered to settle the issue. By 1954, the institution was ready with a proposal on allotment of the waters of the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab, except for minor uses in Jammu and Kashmir, to Pakistan, and those of the Sutlej, Ravi and Beas to India. Though this allotment was accepted by India, Pakistan had reservations.\\n\\nIn the meantime, an ad-hoc transitional arrangement was signed for 1955-56 on October 31, 1955, in Washington D C by N D Gulhati, then a joint secretary to Government of India, and G Mueenuddin, OSD in Pakistan’s Industries Ministry. But, the larger issue remained unresolved.\\n\\nThe biggest hold-up to the World Bank’s proposal was the cost of replacement works, estimated to be nearly Rs 700 crore. Of that, Rs 620 crore — 60% of which was a grant — came from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK, the US, West Germany and the World Bank. The rest, around Rs 83 crore, was to be given by India in 10 installments to the World Bank. The money was constituted as a separate fund, named the Indus Basin Development Fund, which was managed by the World Bank.\\n\\nIt was estimated that the replacement works would be completed within 10 years, starting from 1960. Pakistan was offered a three-year extension, if required, subject to a penalty of Rs 4 crore per annum. Six years after it was originally proposed, Pakistan finally agreed to sign the plan.\\n\\nOn the day he signed the IWT, Nehru announced that “… a very difficult and complicated problem which has troubled India and Pakistan for many years has been satisfactorily solved”. Though it was signed in September 1960, the proposal was effective from April 1960 onwards.\\n\\nHowever, the pact led to an uproar in Parliament. Weeks after his return from Karachi, Nehru clarified during a debate on the issue in Lok Sabha on November 30, 1960, “Naturally, one can always say that instead of Rs 80 crore, if we pay Rs 50 crore, we will be gainers by Rs 30 crore and if we do not pay anything at all, we will be gainers by Rs 80 crore. But we are not talking in terms of agreements, but in terms of disagreements, of continuing disagreements and taking the consequences of those disagreements. In such matters, water especially and other matters, what one gains is infinitely more than a sum that we may give now or later.”\\n\\nDefending the World Bank’s role, he said, “(It) suggested that it might be a good thing if India and Pakistan had the advantage of associating the World Bank with it, with the expert engineers, etc., and that it might help.”\\n\\nDespite his assurances, leaders like Madhu Limaye, J B Kripalani, Balraj Madhok and Atal Bihari Vajpayee opposed the IWT. While Surendra Mohanty of the Gantantra Party called it a “treaty of surrender”, Vajpayee, then a first-time MP from Balrampur, cautioned that “despite this treaty, no one knows that Pakistan will behave like our friend.”\\n\\nIn May 1964, Nehru died. In August 1965, India went to war with Pakistan over territorial disputes, particularly Kashmir. A few months after the ceasefire in the 1965 war, there were demands to end the IWT. Responding in the Lok Sabha on November 10, 1965, then Irrigation Minister K L Rao said, “The breaking of the treaty at this stage is …not at all proper having regard to this fact that this treaty is a sort of tripartite treaty and not merely between India and Pakistan.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, Pakistan finished constructing the Mangla Dam under the IWT’s terms in 1967. As she was flying over Pakistan while on her way to Moscow, then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi sent a congratulatory message to General Ayub Khan, then Pakistan President, on the completion of the dam.\\n\\nOn her return to India, just like her father in the winter of 1960, Indira had to deal with an uproar in Parliament, with Opposition leaders still maintaining that the IWT “was against India’s interests”.\\n\\nThe writer is Senior Associate Editor, The Indian Express',\n",

       "  'Delhi Hardlook: To pursue or not to pursue? Delhi University’s undergraduates face a crucial decision on the new four-year degree programme\\n\\nCome July, DU’s undergraduates will have to make a crucial choice — continue with the newly introduced four-year degree or exit after three years. While students make up their minds, colleges are scrambling to put together the necessary infrastructure and resources\\n\\nSitting with his juniors, surrounded by the red-brick corridors of St Stephen’s College, Delhi University student Adithyan Ajith is clear about his plans for the future — he wants to pursue a fourth year at the varsity.\\n\\n“It’s not just about one more year,” he says. “It’s about opening the door to places like the London School of Economics.”\\n\\nThe 20-year-old History (Honours) student from Kerala will be among the first batch of DU undergraduates who, come July, must choose whether to continue with the newly formalised fourth year under the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 or exit with a standard three-year degree.\\n\\nFor Adithyan, who comes from a middle-class family — his father is an engineer and his mother a homemaker — the decision is clear. “I want to build a solid application — dissertation, recommendations, everything. That fourth year gives me the kind of academic depth and research experience that top global universities expect.”\\n\\nDU officials agree. The four-year course under the Undergraduate Curriculum Framework (UGCF 2022), which replaces the three-year system, is more than just an academic extension, they argue. It’s a move to ensure students from India’s largest central university are no longer turned away from graduate programmes abroad for lack of a “complete” undergraduate degree.\\n\\n“A four-year BA course is being introduced not only to align with NEP provisions but to ensure a DU student can easily apply to colleges abroad,” says a senior DU official.\\n\\n“Every student admitted in 2022 was enrolled under the four-year framework. It’s up to them whether to exit after the third year. If they wish to leave, they have to inform their college, which will issue a transfer certificate.”\\n\\nThe final year offers four academic tracks:\\n\\nDissertation Writing: For academic research, higher studies.\\n\\nAcademic Projects: Involving fieldwork, data collection, and documentation.\\n\\nEntrepreneurship: To design business models and develop startups.\\n\\nAdditional Discipline-Specific Electives (DSEs) and Skill-Based Modules: For Programme students, students of the School of Open Learning, and Non-Collegiate Women’s Education Board (NCWEB).\\n\\nStudents can choose either option should they opt for the fourth year. They must complete 176 credits to graduate, up from 132 (under the three-year programme).\\n\\nThe DSE track is a recent addition, meant for students pursuing Programme courses. “Not all students want to write a dissertation or build a startup,” says Ratna Bali, Dean of Academic Affairs. “We’ve added a fourth track to make it more inclusive, especially for those in BA (Programme) or from Open Learning backgrounds.”\\n\\nDU officials say the curriculum for the seventh and eighth semesters was passed by the Academic Council (AC) on May 10 and will be presented before the Executive Council on May 23.\\n\\nThe Indian Express speaks to students, teachers and colleges on the ambitious course and the challenges that come with it.\\n\\nWhile Adithyan is clear about the value of a fourth year, many of his peers are not. He says, “In our orientations, professors shared presentations about the various tracks, but the details were vague. Nobody has shown us how it will be implemented.”\\n\\nAdithyan will complete his required 80 credits by the end of his third year. If he chooses to exit in July, he will receive a BA Honours degree, as per the Undergraduate Curriculum Framework (UGCF) 2022.\\n\\nIf he continues into the fourth year and opts for a research track, he stands to graduate with a BA Honours with Research degree — a distinction that significantly strengthens applications for postgraduate programmes abroad.\\n\\nFor students in Programme courses, however, the course structure doesn’t appear to be in their favour.\\n\\nSujeet Gupta, who is studying a BA Programme course in History and Political Science from Sri Venkateswara College, aspires to pursue a PhD.\\n\\nBut the 20-year-old, who hails from Bihar’s Gopalganj, says there is a lot of confusion. “They’ve held multiple orientations, but every time we ask questions, we get different answers. Even the faculty is unsure. I am pinning my hopes on CUET-PG — if I get a good opportunity in counselling, I’ll exit after three years.”\\n\\nIf Gupta does exit at the end of three years, he won’t be eligible for an Honours degree. He will only receive a BA Programme degree.\\n\\nUnder the current framework, students enrolled in the BA, BSc, or BCom Programme courses wanting an Honours-level qualification must accumulate the minimum of 80 core discipline credits by completing the fourth year.\\n\\nIf Gupta continues into the fourth year and completes additional DSEs and two-credit skill-based modules in both semesters, he would be awarded a BA Honours degree — but without the “Research” nomenclature.\\n\\nThis is because, as per DU’s current policy, students in Programme courses are not eligible for the ‘Honours with Research’ tag — even if they undertake academic projects or a dissertation.\\n\\n“This is unfair, I believe,” says Gupta. “A student who joined in the same year is going to get a research degree after completing four years, but a programme student will not get one!”\\n\\n“I would prefer to exit and apply for a two-year Master’s degree because in our country, especially in good universities like JNU, PhD seats are limited. And preference is always given to a student who completes a two-year Master’s programme rather than just one year,” he adds.\\n\\nThis is not the first time DU has experimented with a four-year UG programme — nor is it the first time it has divided the academic community.\\n\\nIn 2013, under then V-C Dinesh Singh, the varsity introduced the Four-Year Undergraduate Programme (FYUP), framed as a bold step towards aligning Indian undergraduate education with global standards. It proposed multiple exit points — a certificate after one year, a diploma after two, a general degree after three, and an honours degree after four.\\n\\nFrom the start, the programme was met with resistance. The Delhi University Teachers’ Association led vocal protests, arguing that the implementation had been rushed, poorly conceived, and carried out without meaningful consultation.\\n\\nWhen the BJP-led government took office in 2014, the FYUP was among the first education reforms to be scrapped. The University Grants Commission (UGC), which had initially supported the programme, reversed its position. Then UGC Chairman Ved Prakash ordered DU to roll back the programme just ahead of the admission season.\\n\\nSpeaking to The Indian Express, Dinesh Singh defends the programme: “FYUP introduced at DU was the first major reform at the undergraduate level in India. It steered the curriculum, without academic compromise, towards addressing the needs and challenges of society and the nation. As a result, the university’s global rankings surged ahead of several IITs and came very close to breaking into the top 200.”\\n\\nA member of the 70-member task force that helped implement the FYUP says, “We saw graduates from top DU colleges doing well in exams but failing to secure jobs — not because of poor scores, but because they couldn’t communicate in basic English or demonstrate critical thinking. FYUP was designed as a necessary intervention to change that. UGCF 2022 under NEP 2020 is essentially the same idea, only with a different name…”\\n\\nEven though the four-year programme has come into force now, DU still has several challenges ahead. With over 70,000 new undergraduate students each year across 70+ affiliated colleges, accommodating a fourth year will strain already limited resources.\\n\\nTo prepare for the student influx, colleges have begun expanding their campuses.\\n\\nAt Aryabhatta College, expansion is in full swing. The college is adding around 40 more classrooms and 20 labs to accommodate the academic load of the fourth year. “This is the youngest college of Delhi University, and this is how we are gearing up for the fourth year,” says Principal Manoj Sinha.\\n\\nAt Ramjas College, Principal Ajay Arora says similar efforts are on. “We just finished constructing a fifth floor in one of the buildings for incoming students,” he says. “All we need to do is add some furnishing and wiring in these rooms. We have come up with six big rooms which can be converted into 12 classrooms and two seminar halls.”\\n\\nAs per official college data, Ramjas currently has 83 classrooms, 32 labs, and 26 washrooms for over 5,000 students.\\n\\n“Beyond the 9-to-5 time structure, if colleges are not in a position to add physical infrastructure, they will have to create flexibility in the timetable,” Arora says, referring to the University Grants Commissions’s “8 to 8” policy that allows class scheduling from 8 am to 8 pm to optimise space.\\n\\n“Teacher requirements will increase. All colleges will be approaching the funding agency for sanctioning of additional posts for both teaching and non-teaching staff,” he adds.\\n\\nAt Hindu College, the current infrastructure includes 45+ classrooms and over 20 labs, but Principal Anju Srivastava says even that may fall short.\\n\\n“In today’s situation, we can’t accommodate all students. More teachers are required, and labs will have to be modified accordingly,” she says. “We had meetings with teachers even in April to discuss the new curriculum. Now that CUET-PG results are out, we’ll get a clearer picture of how many students might opt to stay on [for the fourth year].”\\n\\nSrivastava estimates that approximately 35–40% of the college’s 5,000 students will likely continue into the fourth year. “Around 5–10% of students are interested in research, especially those who want to apply for prestigious scholarships like Rhodes.”\\n\\nOn the residential front, the girls’ hostel accommodates around 150 students, while the boys’ hostel, previously capped at 250, is being expanded to 500. There are also plans to double the girls’ hostel capacity.\\n\\nAt Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC), infrastructure includes approximately 34 classrooms and seven labs, but the college faces unique constraints.\\n\\nLocated within walking distance of the Rajpur Cemetery, the final resting place of soldiers who died in the 1857 revolt, SRCC falls within a heritage-regulated zone. The campus is governed by the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010; the Delhi Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 2004; and the MCD bylaws.\\n\\nThese laws prohibit any alteration to buildings within 100 metres of a heritage site, limiting SRCC’s ability to construct new blocks or expand vertically.\\n\\nPrincipal Simrit Kaur says, “We estimate that around 30-40% of students will return for the fourth year, while the rest may opt for placements. The modalities are still being worked out — workload is being divided, and we are awaiting a concrete plan. There is going to be a faculty resource crunch, and apart from increasing teaching hours, we don’t see any other way out.”\\n\\nMiranda House, too, is undergoing spatial restructuring. The college currently has 78 classrooms, six computer labs, and 10 research labs, with a student strength of over 4,000.\\n\\n“At least 60% of students will stay back for the fourth year,” says Principal Bijayalaxmi Nanda. “Around 5–10% of our students go abroad for higher education every year. We are waiting for the master plan approval. They wanted a new hostel; now we’re planning to add a floor to the existing hostel building instead.”\\n\\nTo meet immediate space demands, Miranda has added two porta cabins on the top floor of one of the buildings and started holding classes in them. “We are freeing up areas, emptying storerooms, and reorganising spaces to accommodate teaching,” Nanda adds.\\n\\nThe girls’ hostel currently accommodates around 450 students, with plans to double this capacity in the long term.\\n\\nAs colleges scramble to expand physical space, recruit teaching staff, and restructure timetables to accommodate a new academic year, faculty members across institutions remain divided — not on the merits of the fourth year, but on the feasibility of implementing it meaningfully.\\n\\nDr Maya John, faculty at Jesus and Mary College and elected AC member, says, “What bureaucrats… conveniently will not tell you is that an additional year of UG teaching comes without additional funds and faculty…”\\n\\nShe warns of systemic failure unless additional resources are provided: “Without increased funding and sanctioned teaching positions, we are looking at a scenario of chaos, compromised quality of UG-level research, and reinforced inequality.”\\n\\nJohn also points to the lack of awarding ‘Honours with Research’ designation for BA, BSc, and BCom Programme students in both regular and distance modes. “This amendment comes in light of the administration’s reluctant recognition that current faculty cannot supervise scores of dissertations. But to make such a change after students were admitted amounts to cheating…,” she says.\\n\\nDr Harendra Nath Tiwari, faculty at SRCC and member of DU’s Standing Committee on Academic Affairs, voices support for the structural goals of the four-year programme — though he too acknowledges infrastructural and funding constraints. “It introduces students to research, allows them to complete their master’s in a year… It also aligns students with global postgraduate systems — no bridge course is required abroad.”\\n\\nTiwari urges the government to step up with resources. “We are already demanding that the government provide additional funds and sanctioned posts.”\\n\\nHe says these demands were raised at the AC meeting on May 10. “We flagged the need for more infrastructure, expansion of research labs, and faculty hiring — both teaching and non-teaching — to make this rollout successful. The vision is good, but we need real support to implement it.”\\n\\nFor now, students are at the juncture of pivotal academic decisions.\\n\\n“Maybe the system will become clearer for future batches,” says Gupta. “For us, it feels like we’re experimenting with it.”',\n",

       "  'Cannes review: Nouvelle Vague, a warm homage to the pioneers of French New Wave\\n\\nLinklater’s film will make those who adore Breathless nostalgic. Set in 1969, it is black and white, but it’s not the luscious-lambent period black-and-white which could have distanced us; the matter-of-fact palette makes it all very life-like.\\n\\nA film about cinephiles for cinephiles is one way to describe ‘Nouvelle Vague’ (New Wave), Richard Linklater’s love letter to movies. You could also say that it is about the making of ‘Breathless’, which it is. But it’s truly, gloriously more. It’s about being young and alive, broke and audacious, lucking into friends who make you come alive, having each other’s backs — all while changing the world.\\n\\nIn the 50s, a bunch of French film critics were busy discovering the joys of ‘middlebrow Hollywood commercial’ cinema, which was treated with disdain by a high-minded earlier generation. Jacques Rivette, Eric Rohmer, Chaude Chabrol, Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard were among those who contributed to Cahiers du Cinema, a journal which published these rebels-with-a-righteous-cause.\\n\\nBut writing trenchant prose and tearing into fresh releases for their scrappy journal wasn’t enough after a time, and many of these turned to making their films. Thus was born the ‘French New Wave’, which changed the way movies were made.\\n\\nHow this particular group of film critics-turned-filmmakers became so influential — they may have been the ‘OG influencers’ — has been the subject of weighty tomes, but those who saw the films when they came out, and the scholars who came after were unanimous that Godard’s debut A Bout de Souffle (‘Breathless’, 1960) was an instant classic.\\n\\nLinklater’s film will make those who adore Breathless nostalgic. Set in 1969, it is black and white, but it’s not the luscious-lambent period black-and-white which could have distanced us; the matter-of-fact palette makes it all very life-like.\\n\\nThe actors who play Godard (Guillaume Marbeck), Jean-Paul Belmondo (Aubry Dullin) and Jean Seberg (Zoey Deutch), Truffaut (Adrien Rouyard), Chanrol (Antoine Besson), could practically be doppelgangers, so amazingly alike are they.\\n\\nAll the familiar markers are in here. Belmondo’s lips (the New Wavers loved Brando), Seberg’s uber-stylish striped dresses, thin cigarettes, long tail-finned cars, cobbled Parisian streets, stubby handguns, and the catchy score take you right back to your first encounter with Breathless, when you were instantly smitten with French petty thieves and their pert American girl-friends while waiting for ‘that’ shot that made movie history.\\n\\nBut while ‘Nouvelle Vague’ is a homage, it isn’t reverential. You can see Godard being annoying and obdurate. Early on, Seberg demands make-up and the former refuses it; in another instance, the director dismisses the person in charge of continuity, saying that’s not what life is about. One of the pleasures of the film is how he uses famous quotes, as do several other characters: it’s all very self-aware and a lot of fun.\\n\\nBoth Dullin, who captures Belmondo’s sunny sexiness, and Deutch, all radiance even when she is irritated, are terrific: did Belmondo and Seberg have a moment in real life? We see a distinct, momentary spark.\\n\\nAlso Read | Express at Cannes: Sergei Lozintsa’s brooding, atmospheric Two Prosecutors and hard-hitting police procedural Dossier 137\\n\\nMarbeck’s Godard is impeccable. His trademark dark glasses do not come off anywhere in the film, even when he somersaults. His whims ( pack up, the shoot is over, or no shoot today because not-in-the-mood), the producer’s panicky rants, and the baffled faces of the cast and crew do become a tad repetitive, and I did become a bit restive in those bits.\\n\\nBut perhaps it was important to recount just how shambolic, and learning-on-the-job the making of ‘Breathless’ was, not just for the mercurial, brilliant Godard, but for the rest of the cast too, who had no idea that they were at work on something that would turn iconic in its first run itself.\\n\\n‘Breathless’ rewrote the rules of the game. Godard jumped. So did the movies.',\n",

In the 37-second clip, the langur climbs down from a terrace, grabs the roti from the boy’s hands, and begins eating it beside him. As the startled child starts crying, the langur munches on the stolen roti.\\n\\nThe boy’s father, instead of comforting his son or stepping in, continues filming. The man is heard saying, “Baithe raho, kaatega nahi” (Keep sitting, he won’t bite). As the child sobs, a woman, possibly the man’s wife, can be heard saying, “Arre woh ro raha hai. Hataa lo” (He is crying, take him away), but the father responds with a casual, “Nahi kaatega. Papa hai toh” (He won’t bite.

       "  'China curbs on rare earth magnets: Electric Vehicle makers face shortage, approach govt\\n\\nBeijing insists on undertakings on nature of use, endorsement of importer\\n\\nNew restrictions on rare earth magnets and related materials imposed by China, as a direct response to US imposing tariffs that kicked in from April 4, are beginning to impact automakers across the world, including electric vehicle manufacturers in India.\\n\\nEV makers here are staring at a potential shortage of the critical components, which raises concerns of price hikes and production delays in a nascent, cost-sensitive segment of the auto market.\\n\\nThe Indian car industry is learnt to have initiated a conversation with the government to smoothen the process for procuring the rare earth magnets from Beijing. While the Chinese government has not imposed an outright ban on the export of rare earth magnets—a crucial element in making EVs—the process has been made very difficult causing protracted delays and posing shortage risks.\\n\\nRare earth magnets, especially neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets, are crucial for EV manufacturing, particularly in electric motors. They provide the strong magnetic fields needed for efficient and powerful electric motors, including traction motors that drive EVs. These magnets also play a major role in other EV components like power steering systems, wiper motors, and braking systems. China has a near monopoly over these rare earth magnets.\\n\\nA senior executive from the Indian car industry told The Indian Express that importers are now required to give their Chinese suppliers an undertaking that the rare earth magnets procured from that country would only be used in vehicles and not for defence or military applications.\\n\\n“What’s making the process more cumbersome is that the Chinese side is also insisting that local governments issue an endorsement for their importers. In our case, that would be the Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), which will have to endorse each importer separately. A separate authorisation must also be sought from the Chinese Embassy,” the executive said on condition of anonymity. “We are talking to the government about how the process can be made better, because it is clear that the industry would need their help.”\\n\\n“We are also looking at sourcing rare earth magnets from alternate sources, but China is really the leader in the field. It could take some time,” a second executive said. Queries sent to the Ministry of Heavy Industries and DGFT did not elicit a response.\\n\\nOver the past month or so, Indian carmakers are learnt to have used up inventories and the shortage is likely going forward.\\n\\nWorrying still is a fresh insistence from Beijing that instead of sourcing magnets separately, carmakers buy entire electric motor assemblies from Chinese companies, or simply wait for the Chinese authorities to issue export permits to local rare earth magnet producers, as has been done, according to Reuters, for at least four magnet producers that include suppliers to Volkswagen – the first granted since Beijing restricted shipments last month.\\n\\nThe German carmaker is said to have lobbied hard with Beijing to get this done.\\n\\nRare earth magnets provide the strong magnetic fields needed for efficient and powerful electric motors, including traction motors that drive EVs. The magnets also play a major role in other EV\\n\\ncomponents like power steering systems, wiper motors, and braking systems. China dominates their market.\\n\\nThe problem with sourcing entire motors, as against just the magnets in them, is that carmakers would have to redesign their cars to accommodate the entire motor assembly, which comes in standard sizes. The ability to import magnets meant that manufacturers could calibrate the motor sizes to the design of their vehicles.\\n\\nWhile the availability of rare earth metals is not limited to China, it is in the efficient processing of these critical elements where Beijing has a substantial lead, which was once enjoyed by the US and Japan.\\n\\nIn recent years, Japan has been able to restart some of its minerals’ processing industry owing to government policies, but countries like the US and India are heavily dependent on Chinese exports of these metals.\\n\\nIn response to the US administration’s reciprocal tariff heat, China restricted exports of seven heavy rare earth metals including samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium, as well as rare earth magnets,\\n\\nEarlier, it had also banned exports to the US of gallium, germanium, antimony, and other key high-tech materials with potential military applications.\\n\\nIt is not clear if the recent thaw in US-China trade talks, including a pause, is going to affect these supplies.\\n\\nSoumyarendra Barik is Special Correspondent with The Indian Express and reports on the intersection of technology, policy and society.

At the venue, he patiently clicked photographs with all those who approached him, asked students about their studies, reassured a shy child by saying he looked “very handsome” — and eventually had to remove his astronaut jacket to leave without further delay.\\n\\nEdited excerpts from the interview:\\n\\nThere are definitely certain parallels between the two domains — while saying this, I do not want to imply that piloting is essential for becoming an astronaut. Astronautics is all about doing science in space; it should be accessible to one and all. We need people from all communities — scientists, doctors, engineers, philosophers, those from the arts and commerce world, as well as pilots.\\n\\nWhen space becomes accessible to everyone — more and more human beings sent from across the world — we will start thinking of ourselves as representatives of our planet. That is when we will grow beyond the smaller issues we are embroiling ourselves in.\\n\\nIt just so happens that space travel is all about aviating: if you want to go to space, you need to traverse the atmosphere, and when you come back, you again need to traverse the atmosphere. What this requires is a lot of quick decision-making and staying ahead of a very, very fast-moving machine. The speed at which the machine is moving requires your brain to function even faster… A lot of these things are experienced by pilots here on Earth. Experientially, piloting is very close to being an astronaut. It’s not that others aren’t capable; they’re simply not trained for it.\\n\\nSo, test pilots — by virtue of their academic prowess and their experience aviating inside fast-moving vehicles — are more suitable and more easily trainable, and thus are given preference whenever a prototype spaceflight starts.\\n\\nAnyone who had cleared the test pilot examination — the most difficult examination in the Indian Air Force — was considered eligible. There were IQ tests, flying-skills assessments, and stress-tolerance evaluations.\\n\\nIn the process, what I realised was that your knowledge can always be prepared. I’ll draw an analogy with a computer: if you have an adequate hard drive and RAM, you can load any program. So the selection process was really about checking the size of the processor capability.\\n\\nIn fact, there were many people brighter than us in various fields who did not make it. There were essentially a number of boxes you had to tick, and if even one box was unchecked, you could be the brightest human being but still get rejected. I know of brilliant test pilots who lost out due to factors beyond their control — for example, the medical evaluation. So, you have to thank your stars if you do make it.\\n\\nNormally, space experiments are conducted inside large, almirah-sized racks onboard a space station. But Gaganyaan only has the crew module — no racks, just a small, box-like apparatus. Most experiments, as worldwide, will be in microbiology, materials science, and combustion engineering. These three fields can propel space exploration to the next level — interplanetary travel.\\n\\nThe best way to perform any experiment is to have the scientist onboard the station so settings can be tweaked and improvised to get good results. That may not always be possible. Instead, there are short-duration experiments with many autonomous features. So someone with some knowledge of how the experiment works, what results are expected, and an understanding of data purity and integrity can initialize the sequences. None of this develops overnight — you train for a good five to six months on a lot of maths and statistics.\\n\\nAn astronaut has to train for many things that other human beings don’t, because they enjoy the comforts of our planet…\\n\\nThere is a lot of attention that comes with being an astronaut — your life becomes public. I learn so much from interacting with people: their dreams inspire me and have deeply impacted my personal growth. I’ve seen other astronauts share the same view.\\n\\nIt’s one of our responsibilities to further the cause of science and to inspire others to take up science. I always tell young students to stay in India, not chase quick money, but invest in unique opportunities such as working with ISRO.\\n\\nThe interaction was a bit personal. Last year, my mother — who was terminally ill — came all the way from Bengaluru for the ceremony. I requested the Prime Minister, ‘Can you please meet her?’ and he obliged. Normally, to meet the PM you have to undergo a Covid test and follow strict protocol. He said it didn’t matter and that he would meet her. He is magnanimous that way. This was in February last year, and I lost her in August.\\n\\nMore important, however, was his vision for space. ISRO has laid out a solid roadmap, but we all need to understand that it requires sustained financial support. It’s encouraging that the Government is handholding my parent space agency and that ISRO is also committing its resources.\\n\\nAnonna Dutt is a Principal Correspondent who writes primarily on health at the Indian Express.

Today, I have come to say with pride that the revenge of Pahalgam has been taken by decimating the headquarters of (terror outfits) Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba,” Shah said.\\n\\n‘Entered 100km deep into Pakistan’\\n\\nLauding the efforts of the Indian military, Shah said, “Our military has accomplished the task of giving answer to terrorists by entering 100 km deep into Pakistan.”\\n\\nHe said that the sounds of Indian bombs have given a clear message to terror handlers that if such an act is committed against India, it will be replied to with double the force.\\n\\nThe Union Home Minister said that while India had struck only terror camps, the Pakistan military attacked innocent civilians across India’s western border. However, he added, India’s air defence system has become so perfect that not a single missile or drone could land on the country’s soil.\\n\\nShah further said that in reply, Indian forces attacked 15 military locations in Pakistan without damaging their civilians and sent a message that they cannot stop Indian missiles.\\n\\n“For the first time, after Independence, Indian forces entered 100 km inside Pakistan and demolished camps of terrorists. And they (Pakistan) were threatening (us), saying that they have an\\n\\natom bomb. They thought that we would be frightened by their threats. But it did not happen and our air force, army and navy gave a befitting reply,” Shah said.\\n\\n‘Entire world praising Indian military’s precision’\\n\\nShah said that the entire world is praising “Indian military’s precision to strike, its restraint and political will of Prime Minister Modi”.\\n\\nShah said that in future, whenever there would be discussion on military operations in the world, Operation Sindoor will be part of it. He said that the Operation was named Sindoor by PM Modi himself “in honour of mothers and sisters” of India.\\n\\n“The losses sustained by victim families (of Pahalgam terror attack) cannot be compensated, but Modiji certainly fulfilled the promise he made in Bihar of taking revenge by decimating the terrorists,” Shah added.\\n\\nShah said PM Modi has not only made efforts for development, but also made the country secure.',\n",
       "  'Fraud-accused former UCO Bank Chairman moves bail citing ill health\\n\\nSanjay Sureka, the main promoter of CSPL, who was arrested by the ED in December 2024, also moved for bail on Wednesday\\n\\nOn Wednesday, former Chairman and Managing Director of UCO Bank, Subodh Kumar Goel, was produced before Chief Judge Sukumar Ray at the City Sessions Court. Goel’s counsel moved for bail, citing the 74-year-old’s deteriorating health, including Parkinson’s disease and a rare hereditary condition.\\n\\n“My client is not only sick but also infirm,” his counsel stated. “He has been suffering from SCA-12 (a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterised by progressive hand tremors, mild to moderate gait ataxia, and other neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms) since 2018. The disease is progressive in nature.”\\n\\nDescribing Goel’s current state, the counsel added, “A scan has been done. He is dependent on assistance for daily living. An MRI of the brain shows decreased brain volume and impaired blood flow. He is wheelchair-bound, reliant on family members, has a history of falls, has Parkinson’s, diabetes, and is disoriented to time and place.”\\n\\nThe counsel further argued that during the five days of Enforcement Directorate (ED) custody, Goel developed oral fungal infections and his condition has worsened. “Due to his declining health, bail should be granted under any circumstances,” he stated.\\n\\n“I have responded to the summons and fully cooperated. My statement has been recorded. I submitted 25 documents on May 7. On May 12, I informed authorities that I was undergoing treatment and needed time to recover. What changed suddenly? My family has fully cooperated. I need medical treatment and can remain in Kolkata,” the counsel stated on Goel’s behalf.\\n\\nHowever, the ED opposed the bail plea. “I arrested him on May 16 and took him to a government hospital in Delhi,” said the ED representative. “Reports from AIIMS and RML hospitals state that he is slow but able to walk, follows verbal commands, and can continue oral and anti-Parkinson medication.”\\n\\nRefuting claims of medical neglect, the ED submitted, “On May 17, the Salt Lake Subdivisional Hospital reported the patient was clinically stable. On May 18, after custody, no abnormalities were detected, including in his heart, though a cardiology consultation was advised. On May 19, the doctor noted that while the patient claimed to have Parkinson’s, he was unable to provide proper medical history. Over the last four days, he managed basic tasks—eating, using the washroom, changing clothes—by himself. Only from May 19 did he claim he couldn’t walk and needed a wheelchair. Since he allegedly suffers from an incurable condition, further hospital treatment is not necessary, and the ground of infirmity does not arise.”\\n\\nGoel was arrested from his Delhi residence on May 16 in connection with a massive Rs 6,210 crore bank loan fraud case. The investigation is being conducted under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and involves M/s Concast Steel & Power Limited (CSPL) and others.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Sanjay Sureka, the main promoter of CSPL, who was arrested by the ED in December 2024, also moved for bail on Wednesday. A chargesheet against him was filed before the Kolkata court in February this year. The ED had attached assets worth Rs 510 crore belonging to Sureka and CSPL through two orders issued under the PMLA.\\n\\nSureka’s counsel argued that after 156 days in custody and with no imminent commencement of trial, bail should be granted. The court has adjourned his bail plea till June 2',\n",

The first clinic is operational, and we will open one in every district,” he added.\\n\\nThe clinic was launched under the Indian Brain Health Initiative with support from NITI Aayog and the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences (IHBAS), said officials. With the government planning to open such clinics in each of the city’s 11 districts, IHBAS will provide technical support – training teams, standardising protocols, and monitoring outcomes, they added.\\n\\nOfficials further said that the clinic will provide preventive care, early detection, and rehabilitation to patients suffering from conditions such as stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, dementia, and headache disorders.\\n\\nRajinder K Dhamija, chairperson of the NITI Aayog task force, said the clinic will provide comprehensive care. “Multi-disciplinary teams will be present, including neurologists, clinical psychologists, and therapists. We will also provide care for all kinds of psychiatric disorders.”\\n\\nHe said the move has been taken amid an increase in the number of mental and brain health problems facing people.',\n",
       "  \"From searching to answers: Qlik CTO explains how AI is reshaping data interaction\\n\\nQlik CTO Sharad Kumar breaks down how enterprise data has evolved from simple spreadsheets to AI-driven decision engines, and why getting the basics right still matters.\\n\\n“If you look at the evolution of data, the earliest uses were basic. People captured data in spreadsheets and notes to make decisions. What has evolved are the techniques and organisational literacy around leveraging it,” said Sharad Kumar, CTO of Qlik, while describing the evolution of data.\\n\\nData is no longer just columns and rows; it has moved on from being a unidimensional fact and figure to something more dynamic. Today, almost every aspect of our life is governed by data, and we have arrived at a point where data is enabling decision-making for organisations. On the sidelines of the recently held Qlik Connect 2025 in Orlando, indianexpress.com caught up with Kumar, who shared his insights on how AI is shaping data integration and modern business strategy.\\n\\nDuring the conversation, Kumar outlined three major transformations in data analytics over the years. He shared that it all began with the centralisation phase with data warehousing. “When we started building data warehouses like Teradata decades ago, it was the first transformational change. We focused on pulling data once, centralising it in one place, and making it easier for people to access. This gave us a backward view of data, which we call descriptive analytics”.\\n\\nThe next phase was predictive analytics. Kumar revealed that this was the phase when machines were being trained and building machine learning algorithms on the same data. Later the world moved from a historical view to a forward-looking view that could predict outcomes for smarter decisions. “Think about recommendation engines on Amazon or Netflix—that’s machine learning in action.”\\n\\nAccording to Kumar, the recent transformation came with the generative AI wave. “Suddenly having access to ChatGPT two years ago completely changed the landscape.” What fundamentally changed was how humans interacted with data. Now it’s not about searching for information; it’s about getting answers—a fundamental switch,” he explained, adding that the evolution continues at an accelerating pace.\\n\\nKumar went on to state that the next wave is already here: agentic AI. With agentic AI, it is not about asking; Kumar feels that one can express their intent, and agents will determine which processes to deploy and in what sequence. “Going from warehousing to predictive took a long time, but the transitions from predictive to generative and from generative to agentic are happening much faster. The pace of change is compressing,” Kumar said.\\n\\nAs generative AI has become a buzzword across the spectrum, we asked Kumar what was hype and what was real when it came to its enterprise use cases. The Qlik executive acknowledged that while generative AI has captured the attention of the C-suite, its implementation hasn’t been an easy one for many.\\n\\nKumar also said that the ground realities are different. “When you talk to data and AI practitioners, you find that the data is not ready. It’s messy, siloed, low quality, not timely, and often can’t be trusted. If you build AI systems on bad data, they will fail,” he said, adding that this was indicative of why success rates remain modest. “Only about 25 per cent of AI projects are truly succeeding in delivering business value. The biggest challenge is the data foundation,” he said.\\n\\nWhen asked how the gap can be closed, Kumar recommended a two-pronged approach. “Enterprises that are succeeding are starting with narrow AI use cases that are contained and less risky. At the same time, they’re focusing on getting their data foundation right, which is the only way to scale AI effectively,” he said.\\n\\nOn being asked how Qlik’s platform supports the journey from raw data to business outcomes, Kumar explained that the platform offers a wholesome assistance to businesses through their data journeys. The executive said that the journey begins with data collection. “First, we provide capabilities to get data from anywhere—databases, SaaS applications, complex systems like mainframe and SAP, files, and streams—at high velocity in near real-time.”\\n\\nData collection is followed by integration. Kumar said that Qlik allows businesses to join and integrate siloed data. “Unless you can join data together, you cannot get a complete picture. If customer information is in one system, purchases in another, and return information in a third, you need to connect these to understand your customer.”\\n\\nAfter integration, building trust in data follows. The company helps businesses by helping them assess data quality, preserving the lineage of data to trace their roots. Later, the Qlik platform enables multiple types of analytics. “Once you have a trusted data foundation, you can build BI visualisation dashboards for descriptive analytics, machine learning models for predictive analytics, and conversational agents for generative AI,” he explained. Kumar added that finally Qlik enables action, as it allows customers to take insights and automate actions on them.\\n\\nWhen it came to challenges faced by enterprises in modernising their data, Kumar revealed that there are three primary challenges, such as data migration, skill gaps, and funding. Data migration is a challenge, as most data today, according to Kumar, continues to be in on-premise systems. Getting this data onto the cloud is a considerable challenge for many.\\n\\nOn the other hand, with many organisations moving to cloud and AI, Kumar feels that most of them often lack the necessary skills, especially for AI implementation. Lastly, with funding, most companies think that they don’t need much budget for AI, as ChatGPT gives the perception that you can quickly apply models. “What we’re finding is that you need a significant budget to fix your data foundation, which is a heavy lift,” he noted.\\n\\nWhen asked what his recommendations would be for organisations, Kumar said, “Funding for data foundation should be rolled into their overall AI initiative funding. If you don’t properly fund your data initiatives and have the right technology and the right skills, you’ll face challenges.”\\n\\nLastly, on being asked what excites him the most about the future of data and AI, the Qlik executive said that potential applications of AI to streamline data workflows are something that he looks forward to. More broadly, he sees AI transforming every aspect of business and daily life.\\n\\nBijin Jose, an Assistant Editor at Indian Express Online in New Delhi, is a technology journalist with a portfolio spanning various prestigious publications.

       "  'From radical student to armed commando: Why Basava Raju’s death is a blow to Maoists\\n\\nChhattisgarh Basava Raju Encounter: The top Naxal leader, security officials say, was the link between the northern and southern commands of the banned CPI (Maoist)\\n\\nChhattisgarh Encounter News: For the two states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, Basava Raju, who was killed in an encounter in Abujhmad on Tuesday, was synonymous with the Maoist party. The 70-year-old hailed from Srikakulam in Andhra Pradesh and was a student of the Regional Engineering College, Warangal.\\n\\n“He was the students’ union president of REC Warangal. He contested elections under the banner of the Radical Students Union,” a top intelligence officer from Telangana said.\\n\\nBasava Raju was known by his birth name, Nambala Keshava Rao, at the time. “This was when the whole of Warangal was influenced by radical outfits. He was one of their important recruits of the 1980s,” the Telangana officer said.\\n\\nIt is believed that Basava Raju went underground in 1985. “He had been leading major operations ever since, and climbed up the ranks of the People’s War Group,” the official said.\\n\\nThe People’s War Group (PWG) and the Maoist Communist Centre merged to form the CPI (Maoist) in 2004.\\n\\nBasava Raju’s death is a major blow to the Communist Party of India (Maoist), intelligence officials in the Telugu states said, because he was the link between the northern and southern commands of the banned outfit. After Ganapathy or Muppala Lakshman Rao quit the post of General Secretary of the banned outfit, Basava Raju stepped into his shoes.\\n\\n“Ganapathy (70) was once known to unite the Naxalbari with the southern command of the party. He was known to have travelled the length and breadth of the country to bring the party under one umbrella. Basava Raju followed in his footsteps,” another Telangana anti-Maoist police official said.\\n\\nBasava Raju would be in West Bengal one day and in Srikakulam the next, all for the party, it was said in local tales, the official said.\\n\\n“He was not just their ideological head but also their combat head, having grown up in the party from a very young age. His death is a major blow and the party could even be disbanded because of it,” the officer claimed, adding that there is no one in the party who could bring the cadre together like Basava Raju. “It is almost impossible for the Maoists to regroup without him.”\\n\\nAfter Kishanji’s (Mallojula Koteswara Rao) killing in 2011 at the age of 56, Basava Raju’s loss will dent the party’s Telugu roots, officials said. “In the ideological warfare, the party’s morale would be pretty low because of this death,” an official said. With the party finding no fresh recruits from Telangana in the past few years, the death of old cadre is fatal for the banned outfit, top officials said.\\n\\n“We would ask the rest of them, the politburo, to surrender as soon as possible,” an official said.',\n",

They have tactically avoided implementation of the reservation in medical and engineering courses,” Sahoo said.\\n\\nThe party also alleged that despite the scheduled tribes (ST) and scheduled caste (SC) communities comprising 22.5 percent and 16.25 percent of state’s total population respectively, the current reservation in technical, medical, and engineering colleges stands at only 12 percent for STs and 8percent for SCs — totalling merely 20 percent.\\n\\n“It falls significantly short of the 38.75 percent combined reservation that should be allocated in proportion to their population, as is the case in other sectors of higher education within the state,” another BJP leader said.\\n\\nThe BJD’s push for social justice comes nearly a year after it lost the assembly elections in the state to the BJP – its first election loss in 24 years. Significantly, 94 percent of the state’s population comprise SC, ST and social and economic backward classes.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Congress too has planned to hold a demonstration outside Odisha Chief Minister Mohan Majhi’s’s residence Thursday demanding 27 percent reservation.\\n\\nOn his part, Odisha Higher Education Minister Suryabanshi Suraj has slammed both the BJD and Congress. “Those who deprived the backward classes of their constitutional rights while in power are now staging demonstrations,” he said.',\n",
       "  'DU Vice-Chancellor: ‘Fourth year a good step for growth of students… will shape them into bright citizens’\\n\\nIf teachers take up extra courses, they will be paid an additional Rs 50,000. Many teachers will be happy with this, says the VC\\n\\nDelhi University Vice-Chancellor Yogesh Singh defends the flexibility provided by the Undergraduate Curriculum Framework (UGCF) 2022 under which the four-year undergraduate degree is being rolled out this year, outlines the rationale behind its design, and explains how the varsity plans to address concerns being raised across campuses.\\n\\nDU is moving into the fourth year of undergraduate education for the first time. What is the strategy?\\n\\nOur strategy is to ensure maximum students join the fourth-year programme. We were giving three tracks for Honours students, but now we have introduced an additional track for Programme students in which the student can complete the fourth year only by studying coursework, without taking on projects. This will be particularly beneficial for students of SOL (School of Open Learning) and NCWEB (Non-Collegiate Women’s Education Board), but all three other tracks are also available to them. So, it is up to the student.\\n\\nThe implementation of UGCF is part of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 rollout. How do you see this benefiting students in the long run?\\n\\nThe four-year degree has come from NEP 2020. Fourth year is essential and it’s a good step for the growth of students… shaping them into the bright citizens of our country. But if someone wants to pursue research, they can pursue a PhD too. But if one wants to pursue post-graduation (PG), a one-year PG will also be available for students. It’s a student-centric choice-based system, and students don’t have to run around unnecessarily. The fourth year will be a terminal degree, and it is a flexible system.\\n\\nThe UGC has directed institutions to adopt an ‘8 to 8’ teaching schedule to accommodate academic load. How is DU responding to this?\\n\\nWorldwide, universities run for longer periods in a day… (having classes) 8 am to 8 pm is a good concept. Infrastructure will improve in colleges… already (infrastructure) is improving based on the need and capacity demanded by students. Confusion on campus is natural, as this is being implemented for the first time. But this will stabilise as we go forward.\\n\\nResearch is now central to undergraduate education. Are DU colleges and faculty prepared for this shift?\\n\\nResearch is very important for higher education institutions. Worldwide, if you look at big universities, they are all research-oriented… This is definitely going to be a shift for our teachers. Colleges are already submitting requests to the UGC for additional postings.\\n\\nFor the fourth year to begin smoothly, we’ve made arrangements for guest faculty and teachers would be paid and given incentives for putting in extra hours. If teachers take up extra courses, they will be paid an additional Rs 50,000. Many teachers will be happy with this.”\\n\\nA concern raised by faculty and students is that BA Programme students are being denied ‘Honours with Research’ tag, even after completing the 4th year. Is this justified?\\n\\nWe don’t think it’s unfair. The students have been admitted into the BA Programme and not under Honours and will be leaving with an Honours degree at the end of four years. This is because the focus of BA Programme students is not on a particular discipline. After the third year, they will focus on the main discipline and will be awarded an Honours.\\n\\nFor Science students, research requires lab space and specialised equipment. How will DU address these needs?\\n\\nRequirements and expansion of labs will be decided based on how many students will join the fourth year. We will get a clear idea of the total number of students in August. If there are challenges, we will create additional infrastructure. We can also think about permitting students to use labs in various departments, depending on availability.'],\n",

The announcement came during the opening keynote of Google’s annual I/O developer conference held in Mountain View, California on Tuesday, May 20, and focused on showing off the company’s latest advancements in AI, Android, augmented reality, and more.\\n\\nOver the coming weeks, users in the US will start to see a new AI Mode tab in Google Search and as a button in the search bar within the Google app.\\n\\nWhile Google on Tuesday drew the curtains back on several new AI products, including the company’s most advanced image and video generation models, AI Mode in Search was the big news to come out of I/O 2025 for two main reasons.\\n\\nGoogle has long dominated the search engine market, shaping the structure of the internet through the rise and fall of content driven by its search engine. But this dominance has come under threat recently with the rise of AI chatbots that have emerged as a viable alternative to looking up information online.\\n\\nIn this context, AI Mode is billed to be the future of Google Search as it moves away from showing users a list of blue links on a web page to providing an end-to-end search experience. However, Google is also facing a prominent antitrust challenge where the US government is pushing for the company’s search business to be broken up after a district court ruled last year that Google had an illegal monopoly of the online search market.\\n\\nAI Mode is powered by a custom version of Google’s Gemini 2.5 frontier model. “AI Mode is where we’ll first bring Gemini’s frontier capabilities, and it’s also a glimpse of what’s to come,” Elizabeth Reid, vice president and head of Google Search, said in a blog post.\\n\\nSearching in AI Mode is different from the typical search on Google as users can dive deeper into the web by asking follow-up questions and finding hyper-relevant content that matches their search query, according to Google. In order to display more helpful responses with web links, AI Mode relies on a query fan-out technique, where AI breaks down the search query into sub-topics and further initiates a multitude of search queries on the user’s behalf.\\n\\nAt I/O, Google also announced new capabilities of AI Mode that will become available to approved users under Google Labs in the coming weeks and months.\\n\\nOne such feature is Deep Search, where AI Mode uses the same query fan-out technique to issue hundreds of searches and gather information across sources in order to generate an ‘expert-level’ research report with citations. This entire process will take minutes, Google claimed.\\n\\nWith Search Live, users can have a back-and-forth vocal conversation with the AI chatbot about what they see on their phone screen or through their phone’s camera. AI Mode will also come with certain agentic capabilities. For instance, when a user asks to book tickets or make restaurant reservations in AI Mode, it will kick off a query fan-out process by scanning several sites and presenting the user with various options.\\n\\nAI Mode will also provide a better shopping experience for users by showing them products and product details in an easy-to-browse panel, along with a virtual try-on feature, AI agent-driven price tracking, and autonomous checkout. This suggests that Google is going toe-to-toe with challengers like OpenAI which recently rolled out its own shopping update to ChatGPT.\\n\\nIn addition, AI Mode will also have the capability to analyse datasets and real-time information to generate graphs, charts, and other visualisations.\\n\\nDuring the Google antitrust search remedies trial, AI prominently featured in the arguments made by both sides.\\n\\nThe US Department of Justice (DOJ) essentially argued that Google’s new AI search products were just another way to lead users to its search engine and thereby extend its dominance of the online search market. It also warned that Google would come to dominate the AI space, the same way it has dominated the search market, if the court did not take any action.\\n\\nGoogle, on the other hand, argued that there is growing competition in AI by pointing to the successes of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and others. It called witnesses like Eddy Cue, an Apple executive, who suggested that AI was shrinking the antitrust threat posed by Google in search. Cue’s testimony, however, tanked Google parent Alphabet’s stock by eight per cent after he revealed that search volume to its Safari browser (which runs on Google’s search engine) had declined for the first time in 22 years.\\n\\nTo reassure shareholders on the threat posed by AI chatbots, Google quickly issued a statement saying that overall queries in Search have continued to grow, and that users are accessing its search functionality in different ways.\\n\\nAt Tuesday’s I/O event, Google’s announcements largely echoed these arguments. It re-emphasised that “there’s been a profound shift in how people are using Google Search” with more than 1.5 billion people using visual search via Google Lens every month. “In our biggest markets like the US and India, AI Overviews is driving over 10 per cent increase in usage of Google for the types of queries that show AI Overviews,” it said.\\n\\nHowever, the accuracy of AI-generated search results is still under question as large language models (LLM) are prone to hallucinations. There are also concerns that Google may further eat into click-through rates as it leans more heavily on AI-generated search results. This would be bad for publishers and content creators who rely on traffic from Google Search.\\n\\nIn terms of privacy, AI search engines could increase user tracking to gather more detailed feedback in order to improve search results. For instance, AI Mode has a personalised context setting which enables it to pull information from other connected Google apps like Gmail to show tailored results. However, Google has said that this will be an opt-in feature, and that users can choose to connect or disconnect the apps with AI Mode at any time.'),\n",

So, when the chance presented itself to check out the Glasses at a demo zone, I queued up for the same without any hesitation.\\n\\nAs I was in the queue, a representative of the Android XR team took away my glasses to scan them for their power. As I reached my turn at the demo a few minutes later, they had a custom lens ready for me.\\n\\nThe Glasses, though a prototype, are comfortable to wear and not really heavy. They have an inbuilt camera, a touch-sensitive temple lined with speakers. The right lens had a small prism on which I could see the time and temperature. As you tap the temple, Gemini wakes up and is ready for your queries. You tap again to pause Gemini.\\n\\nMy first demo was with a painting on the wall as I asked the Glasses to identify the painter. Soon, I could hear a detailed explanation on the painter, with the text of what Gemini was saying showing up on the in-lens display. This took some time for me to adjust to as I use progressive lenses to help me with reading too. But in a few seconds, I could see the text clearly, though this does come in the way of what you are seeing. I think a lot of users might prefer to be guided only by voice when they use the XR Glasses full time.\\n\\nThen I walked over to another demo zone where I was staring at a very unique coffee machine. I asked Gemini how I could make an Espresso with this contraption. The Glasses immediately started telling me how to use the machine. But this is where I found the text coming on the lens a bit of an irritant — again voice would be perfect in a situation where I just needed instructions.\\n\\nFor the next demo, I asked the Android XR Glasses to summarise a page from a Lonely Planet travel guide. Again, it gave a quick summary about the Southern Alps which would have saved me a lot of reading.\\n\\nThat’s when I went off script and asked it to count the number of apples in a bowl on the table. “Six apples,” came the answer. And it took me a while to realise Gemini was right as I thought there were much more apples there. In fact, there were four pears too and the Glasses did a good job of isolating and counting the apples.\\n\\nThe demo lasted just a few minutes, but it left a lasting impression and made me feel the real power of having an AI assistant like Gemini being there to help you with everyday functioning. You can access any app on the phone, take photos, dictate replies to emails and messages. But what makes it even more powerful would be the power to remember everything the camera saw and not just what registered in your brain. Also, this could be like a rewind for your life, and you can technically go back a few days and remember where you left the locker key, or what exactly your friend told you during an argument. The possibilities are endless.\\n\\nAnd remember, what I used was a prototype, and the final product is sure to be much better. I am waiting to buy one, provided it can get my prescription glasses right.\\n\\nNandagopal Rajan writes on technology, gadgets and everything related.
