- Focus on **Just in Time** information rather than just in case information.
	
	some information like news or emails do not check or read it frequently or daily, instead you can check you email once in 2 days. or even for news, do not read at all. you can get important news through your friend or family.
	Most of us consumes so many information which we thought it might be important for later use, but we forget 99% of those information after a week. so make sure to read/consume information only which you will use for today or in this moment.
- **Strict Deadline**
	
	According to Parkinson's Law, work expands to fill the time available for its completion. So, make sure to set strict deadlines for your tasks. And most importantly keep with them. The more time you give to a task, the more time you will take to complete result in wastage of time.
	
- **80/20 Rule**

	80/20 rule is also known as Pareto Principle. So make sure to focus on 20% of the tasks which generate 80% of the results.

	- 80% of the negativity in the world is the results of action of 20% of the population.
	- 20% of your customers generate 80% of your revenue.
	- 20% of drivers cause 80% of traffic accidents.

- **Being busy is not productive**

	get the most important tasks done first. Do not measure it with number of tasks completed or number of hours you put into it. Ask yourself, "Am I making progress/productive(doing the important task)?", if not then move to another important task.
	
- **Eleminate distractions or Switching tasks**

	Your performance suffers when you switch your concentration between various tasks too often.

	Remember, when you are working and sudden you get a notification or message and you lost 5 minutes of checking it, also it takes you 5-10 minutes to get back to your task. 

	One way that task switching can be acheived through **Batching**. Remember, you dont immediately wash your clothes, after getting dirty, you wait for a week or 3 days to wash it. Similarly for groceries, you dont buy it daily, you wait for a week or a month to buy it.

	Is it necessary to check emails regularly? Instead you can check at end of the day or start of the day.
